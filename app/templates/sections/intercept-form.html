    warming up with quadratics,

        Determine the \(x\)-intercepts of this function.

          <div class='inner'>
            First, make sure you are clear on the general concept
            of \(x\)-intercept.  What does "\(x\)-intercept" mean?  Well,
            when thinking of the graph of a function, it sometimes happens
            that the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.  Sometimes it will, sometimes
            it won't.  The locations on the \(x\)-axis (the \(x\)-values)
            at which this happens are the \(x\)-intercepts of the function.
            They are where the graph intercepts or intersects the \(x\)-axis.
            So, a function doesn't have to have \(x\)-intercepts.  Now,
            how do you find them?

            <p>
              To find the \(x\)-intercepts, you figure out how to turn
              an algebraic "lens" or perspective on the graphical concept
              of an \(x\)-intercept.  The \(x\)-intercepts are where the
              function crosses the \(x\)-axis&mdash;and this can be described
              from an algebraic (equation-oriented) point of view as where
              the \(y\)-value is \(0\).  So, to find the \(x\)-intercept(s)
              (if it has any), just plug in \(0\) for \(y\) and try to solve
              for \(x\):
              \[
                0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x + 4)(x - 2)
              \]
              Take a look!  This is where the strength of intercept-form
              is evident.  This format is called "intercept form"
              because you can simply "read off" what the intercepts are from it:
              I can immediately see they will be at \(x = -4\) and \(x = 2.\)
              What am I doing?  I am observing what values I can plug in for
              \(x\) to make the equation true, to make \(y\) come out to 0.
              Because I have my function given as a product (intercept form could also be called
              "factored form"&mdash;meaning it is written as the product
              of factors&mdash;meaning, multiplication!) I know that the only way
              the function can come out to 0 is that one of the factors is 0.
              Think about it: you can't get 0 from multiplying random numbers together
              except when one or both of them is 0!
              So, I see the factor \((x+4)\).  How do I make it come out 0?
              Of course, I just need to have \(x\) be "the opposite" or
              negative of 4.  And the other factor is even easier: What
              can I plug in for \(x\) to make the factor \((x - 2)\) come out
              0?  The answer, quite obviously, is \(2\).

         Find the \((x,y)\)-coordinates of the vertex of this quadratic.
        <div class="answer">
          <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
          <div class='inner'>
            Well, this seems a little harder than the first question.
            The trick is to have our ultimate goal in mind, which is
            to graph this quadratic.  We are going to build a bridge
            from the \(x\)-intercepts&mdash;which were so very easy
            to obtain&mdash;to finding the vertex by first realizing
            that the vertex is as much a graphical or geometric concept
            as it is an algebraic one.  I am going to start by graphing
            the \(x\)-intercepts; then, I will try to trigger a light bulb
            moment for you.  (You see, a student might be tempted
            to take a wholly "algebraic" approach to the solution
            of problems all the time.)  For instance, in the section on
            <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='vertexform') }}">
              vertex form
            </a>
            you may have observed that the vertex shows up in the formula
            for vertex form.  So, an interesting question is, can you
            take intercept form and change it into vertex form?  The answer is "yes,"
            but it is isn't very easy.  The secret of mathematicians is that, while
            they appear to just sit there and push symbols around for a living,
            what they are really doing is marshaling a combination of perspectives
            on a given problem at hand, sometimes looking forward to see
            what different algebraic manipulations might give them but just
            as often switching perspectives and thinking about intuitive pictures
            or representations of the math, such as graphs to represent formulas.
            Then, they figure out how to represent those intuitive processes
            in symbols merely to prove or test the truth of their intuitions.
            This is the general, informal consensus among mathematicians about
            how they work, in my experience in asking them or reading about
            others who have also asked them (as well as in doing mathematics myself).
            An excellent
            resource on this question is Reuben Hersh's,

            </div>

            <p>
              Now, what do we do with the graph?  Well, there really isn't much
              of a graph there, so your first job is to start imagining
              what it might look like.  It will cross through the two \(x\)-intercepts
              we plotted.  And what else?  Perhaps you will be clever enough
              to realize that the parabola will "open down", because of the
              negative out front.  But they key realization you need to have,
              to figure out what the vertex is, is that the graph of this
              function&mdash;some parabola, because it involves a square&mdash;is
              symmetrical.  Therefore, the vertex will lie halfway between the
              two intercepts.  And you can just look: what is halfway on the
              \(x\)-axis between \(-4\) and \(2\)?  The answer is \(-1\).
              You could fiigure that out by noting that the distance between
              the two is 6, and then adding half of that to \(-4\).  But, if
              you write down a representation of that process in a generic
              fashion you will get one more realization.  Here is what I mean.
              Write \(a\) for "the lower number" and write \(b\) for the
              "higher number", meaning the number to the right.  Then
              the difference between them is
              \[
                b - a
              \]
              Then, you add half of that distance to the lower number, \(a\):
              \[
                a + \frac{1}{2}(b-a)
              \]
              Now, you can distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\) and combine like terms:
              \[
                a + \frac{1}{2}b - \frac{1}{2}a = a - \frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}b = \frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}b
              \]
              Note that "one whole \(a\) minus one half of \(a\)" is indeed "one half of \(a\)".
              Now, rewrite that final expression by factoring the \(\frac{1}{2}\)
              back out:
              \[
                \frac{1}{2}\left(a + b\right)
              \]
              You could also write this in a slightly different way as
              \[
                \frac{a + b}{2}
              \]
              So, in the end, what you discover is something which might seem
              obvious in hindsight: the vertex will lie at the average
              of the \(x\)-coordinates.  At least, that will get you the
              \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex, which we already noted it \(-1\).
              It remains to get the \(y\)-coordinate.  That is, we want to know
              "what is the \(y\)-value that gets paired with \(x = -1\)
              by this particular function?"  But isn't that just asking
              what \(y\)-value you get when you plug in that given \(x\)-value?
              Of course it is!  So, you just plug in \(x = -1\) and get what you get:
              \[
                y = -\frac{1}{2}(-1 + 4)(-1 - 2) = -\frac{1}{2}(3)(-3) = \frac{9}{2}
              \]
              Did you notice how you got "the same thing" when plugging in the
              \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex into the two different factors&mdash;except
              one was positive and one was negative?  Does that always happen?
              The answer is, "yes"; that's exactly what happens when you take
              the difference of the average of two numbers from the two numbers
              in succession:
              \[
                \frac{1}{2}(a + b) - a = \frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}b - a = \frac{1}{2}b - \frac{1}{2}a = \frac{1}{2}(b - a)
              \]
              and
              \[
                \frac{1}{2}(a + b) - b = \frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}b - b = -\frac{1}{2}b + \frac{1}{2}a = -\frac{1}{2}(b - a)
              \]
              "Same thing" both times, except one was negative and one was positive.
              SO!  If you don't see that pattern when you plug in the \(x\)-coordinate
              of the vertex, you have made a mistake and will want to check your work.

            <p>
              That helps start to give me an idea of what this thing looks like.
              But I desire greater accuracy.  Plus, the answer checker
              on the exercise pages will require you to plot at least 4 points
              in order to figure out your intentions.  (Plotting the vertex
              is also necessary for the answer checker to understand you.)
              So, figure out at least one more point the graph passes through.
              One way to do this would be to plug in another value for \(x\)
              and see what \(y\) results.  The question is, what \(x\)-value
              would be convenient?
              <!-- Because of the coefficient of
              \(\frac{1}{2}\) in front of the product, I reason that I would
              prefer to have the other factors be even numbers, so that the
              denominator can be cancelled away and I get a whole number
              value for \(y\).  Since both the factors involve taking
              the difference (or, sum, if you prefer) of \(x\) and an even number,
              I ought to plug in a number that lies at a distance of even value
              from the two \(x\)-intercepts.  But I also shouldn't try a number
              too far away from these, because the \(y\)-value might lie outside
              the -10 to 10 viewing window I provide for you, which would
              be annoying.  So, you might plug in \(x = 5\).
              At least that's one way to think about it!
              Really, the way I think about it is that I observe that I already
              know that the \(x\)-intercepts are 2 units away from and
              below the vertex.  That, together with the coefficient of
              \(\frac{1}{2}\) out front helps me realize that this is a
              parabola that opens downward at "\(\frac{1}{2}\)-speed".
              So, the next convenient point to plot is 4 points out from the vertex. -->
              This may vary from problem-to-problem, but, for this one, plugging
              in \(x = 0\) looks easy enough!  (Sometimes plugging
              in 0 for \(x\) may result in a fractional value for \(y\).
              That's okay, but in the exercises you'll need to use the manual-entry
              "Plot Point" field to enter that.)
              Here is what I get:
              \begin{align*}
                y &= \frac{1}{2}(0 + 4)(0 - 2) \\
                & = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 (-2) \\
                & = \frac{1}{2} (-8)\\
                & = -4
              \end{align*}
              Plot that and you then have a pretty good idea of what the parabola
              looks like!  But, if you are drawing this thing by hand rather
              than letting my answer checker fill the rest in for you,
              you will want to be sure to draw your parabola as symmetrically
              as possible.  For instance, since \(x = 0\) lies 1 unit to the right
              of the vertex, we know the \(y\)-value 1 unit to the left of
              the vertex must be the same as the one we just obtained.  So,
              except for with the vertex, on a parabola, you always get
              "two for the price of one" when it comes to plotting points.

    Graph the function
    \[

      <div class="answer">

        <div class='inner'>
          First I obtain the \(x\)-intercepts:
          \[
            x = 3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x = -2
          \]
          I found those using this chain of reasoning:
          <ol>
            <li>\(x\)-intercepts are where a graph crossses the \(x\)-axis</li>
            <li>Algebraically, that is where \(y = 0\).</li>
            <li>\(y\) is given as a product, and the only way to make
            a product equal to 0 is where one or both of its factors are 0.
            So, I just figure out what \(x\)-values make the factors equal 0.
            </li>
            <li>
              \(x = 3\) and \(x = -2\) are clearly the only \(x\)-values that will do that.
            </li>
          </ol>

            I plot the \(x\)-intercepts:
            <div style="text-align:center">
              {% set svg_id = 'svg4' %}
              {% set points = [[3, 0], [-2, 0]] %}
              {% set poly_points = '' %}
              {% set parameters = {
                  'svg_x_length': 350,
                  'svg_y_length': 350,
                  'cart_x_min': -10,
                  'cart_x_max': 10,
                  'cart_x_length': 20,
                  'cart_y_min': -10,
                  'cart_y_max': 10,
                  'cart_y_length': 20
                }
              %}
              {% include "_static_graph.html" %}
            </div>

            <p>
              Next, I find the vertex.  As noted in the first example, I know
              that a parabola is a symmetrical thing.  That means that the vertex
              has to lie halfway between the \(x\)-intercepts.  I also explained
              in the example above that this halfway point
              is also the average of the two \(x\)-values:
              \[
                \frac{3 + (-2)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
              \]
              So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).
              Next, I find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex by plugging
              in the \(x\)-coordinate:
              \begin{align*}
                y &= \left(\frac{1}{2} - 3\right)\left(\frac{1}{2} + 2\right) & \textrm{Plug in \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) }\\
                &= \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{6}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{4}{2}\right) & \textrm{Create common denominators}\\
                &= \left(\frac{-5}{2}\right)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) & \textrm{Add like terms.}\\
                & = -\frac{25}{4} & \textrm{I multiplied.}
              \end{align*}
              Note that when plugging in the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex
              in for \(x\), I get two factors that only differ in sign!
              That's because those factors involve taking the difference
              between \(x\) and the two values that we averaged together
              to get the value we are thus plugging in for \(x\): it is
              halfway between the two, so the difference is the same either way!
              (It's just that one \(x\)-intercept lies <em>below</em>
              the vertex and one lies <em>above</em>.)
              Now plot the vertex:
              <div style="text-align:center">
                {% set svg_id = 'svg5' %}
                {% set points = [[3, 0], [-2, 0], [1/2, -25/4]] %}
                {% set poly_points = '' %}
                {% set parameters = {
                    'svg_x_length': 350,
                    'svg_y_length': 350,
                    'cart_x_min': -10,
                    'cart_x_max': 10,
                    'cart_x_length': 20,
                    'cart_y_min': -10,
                    'cart_y_max': 10,
                    'cart_y_length': 20
                  }
                %}
                {% include "_static_graph.html" %}
              </div>
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, I need to plot at least one more point for the answer
              checker in the exercises to understand my intentions.  (Plus
              you just need more detail to get a clearer picture of what
              the parabola looks like.)
              For this purpose, you can just plug in whatever you like
              for \(x\) (but not one of the 3 values we already know about)
              and see what \(y\)-value gets paired up with it.
              Plugging in \(x = 0\) is often convenient,
              though it isn't guaranteed to be.  Here is what I got:
              \[
                y = \left(0 - 3\right)\left(0 + 2\right) = (-3)(2) = -6
              \]
              Then, I plot that point.  But, while I'm at it, using the
              symmetry of the parabola, I can also plot one other point
              "for free".  I'll get the same \(y\)-value of \(6\) if
              I go the same distance but in the other direction from the
              vertex.  The vertex is at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and we just
              plugged in \(x = 0\) to get \(y = 6\).  The value \(x = 0\) is, of course,
              \(\frac{1}{2}\) units below \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).
              By going \(\frac{1}{2}\) units above \(x = \frac{1}{2}\)
              we get to \(x = 1\), so we know \(y = 6\) for \(x = 1\), as well
              (no computation is necessary, but you could plug in to check
              if you were feeling doubtful.)
              So, I plot both those points and "connect the dots":

    Graph the function

        <div class='inner'>
          First I obtain the \(x\)-intercepts:
          \[
            x = 2 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x = -2
          \]
          I found those using this chain of reasoning:
          <ol>
            <li>\(x\)-intercepts are where a graph crossses the \(x\)-axis</li>
            <li>Algebraically, that is where \(y = 0\).</li>
            <li>\(y\) is given as a product, and the only way to make
            a product equal to 0 is where one or both of its factors are 0.
            So, I just figure out what \(x\)-values make the factors equal 0.
            </li>
            <li>
              \(x = 2\) and \(x = -2\) are clearly the only \(x\)-values that will do that.
            </li>
          </ol>

            I plot the \(x\)-intercepts:
            <div style="text-align:center">
              {% set svg_id = 'svg7' %}
              {% set points = [[2, 0], [-2, 0]] %}
              {% set poly_points = '' %}
              {% set parameters = {
                  'svg_x_length': 350,
                  'svg_y_length': 350,
                  'cart_x_min': -10,
                  'cart_x_max': 10,
                  'cart_x_length': 20,
                  'cart_y_min': -10,
                  'cart_y_max': 10,
                  'cart_y_length': 20
                }
              %}
              {% include "_static_graph.html" %}
            </div>

            <p>
              Next, I find the vertex.  As noted in the first example, I know
              that a parabola is a symmetrical thing.  That means that the vertex
              has to lie halfway between the \(x\)-intercepts.  I also explained
              in the example above that this halfway point
              is also the average of the two \(x\)-values:
              \[
                \frac{2 + (-2)}{2} = \frac{0}{2} = 0
              \]
              So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is \(x = 0\).
              Next, I find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex by plugging
              in the \(x\)-coordinate:
              \[
                y = -\left(0 - 2\right)\left(0 + 2\right) = -(-2)(2) = 4
              \]
              Note that when plugging in the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex
              in for \(x\), I get two factors that only differ in sign!
              That's because those factors involve taking the difference
              between \(x\) and the two values that we averaged together
              to get the value we are thus plugging in for \(x\): it is
              halfway between the two, so the difference is the same either way!
              (It's just that one \(x\)-intercept lies <em>below</em>
              the vertex and one lies <em>above</em>.)
              Now plot the vertex:
              <div style="text-align:center">
                {% set svg_id = 'svg8' %}
                {% set points = [[2, 0], [-2, 0], [0, 4]] %}
                {% set poly_points = '' %}
                {% set parameters = {
                    'svg_x_length': 350,
                    'svg_y_length': 350,
                    'cart_x_min': -10,
                    'cart_x_max': 10,
                    'cart_x_length': 20,
                    'cart_y_min': -10,
                    'cart_y_max': 10,
                    'cart_y_length': 20
                  }
                %}
                {% include "_static_graph.html" %}
              </div>
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, I need to plot at least one more point for the answer
              checker in the exercises to understand my intentions.  (Plus
              you just need more detail to get a clearer picture of what
              the parabola looks like.)
              For this purpose, you can just plug in whatever you like
              for \(x\) (but not one of the 3 values we already know about)
              and see what \(y\)-value gets paired up with it.
              We already know what happens at \(x = 0\), so
              let's plug in \(x = 1\).  Here is what I got:
              \[
                y = -\left(1 - 2\right)\left(1 + 2\right) = -(-1)(3) = 3
              \]
              Then, I plot that point.  But, while I'm at it, using the
              symmetry of the parabola, I can also plot one other point
              "for free".  I'll get the same \(y\)-value of \(3\) if
              I go the same distance but in the other direction from the
              vertex.  The vertex is at \(x = 0\) and we just
              plugged in \(x = 1\) to get \(y = 3\).
              So we know \(y = 3\) for \(x = -1\), as well
              (no computation is necessary, but you could plug in to check
              if you were feeling doubtful.)
              So, I plot both those points and "connect the dots":

  So far, we have looked at examples that ask you to graph a quadratic
  given in intercept form.  Now, to further test your understanding, let's
  try the reverse: can you find an equation in intercept form for a
  graph of a quadratic.  In particular, we will be using key graphical information
  that we can use to determine the intercept form: the \(x\)-intercepts and one
  other point.  In fact, the other point I have chosen to give you is the vertex.
  BUt any other point would do as well.  Time to look at some examples.

  Develop an equation for the given graph.  Note that the vertex is located at
  \((0, 8)\).

          Note first that the \(x\)-intercepts are \(x = -4\) and \(x = 4\).
          That means that \(y\) has to equal 0 when \(x = -4\) or \(x = 4\), which,
          in turn, means that the intercept form of this function will be
          \[
            y = a(x - 4)(x + 4)
          \]
          The only problem is, it is not immediately apparent what the value of
          \(a\) will be.  On the other hand, there is one more piece of information
          that we haven't used: the coordinates of the vertex, \((0, 8)\).
          In particular, we know that when \(x = 0\), \(y = 8\).  Thus, the
          value of \(a\) will have to satisfy this equation:
          \[
            8 = a(0 - 4)(0 + 4)
          \]
          To be clear, all I did was plug in \(x = 0\) and \(y = 8\).
          Now, I simplify and solve:
          \begin{align*}
            & 8 = a(0 - 4)(0 + 4) \\
            \Rightarrow \quad & 8 = a(-4)(4) \\
            \Rightarrow \quad & 8 = -16a \\
            \Rightarrow \quad a = \frac{8}{-16} = -\frac{1}{2}
          \end{align*}
          So, we have the full intercept form:
          \[
            y = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 4)(x + 4)
          \]

          Note first that the \(x\)-intercepts are \(x = -4\) and \(x = -3\).

          The only problem is, it is not immediately apparent what the value of
          \(a\) will be.  On the other hand, there is one more piece of information
          that we haven't used: the coordinates of the vertex,
          \(\left(-\frac{7}{2}, -\frac{1}{8}\right)\).
          In particular, we know that when \(x = -\frac{7}{2}\), \(y = -\frac{1}{8}\).
          Thus, the
          value of \(a\) will have to satisfy this equation:
          \[
