  In this section, we turn to a concept that we will use again and again.
  We can represent a set of ordered pairs&mdash;what a mathematician
  would call a <em>relation</em> as a graph on the \((x,y)\)-plane.
  It's a pretty simple concept&mdash;but one that provides a remarkably
  helpful perspective on equations and functions.  (Recall that a function
  is a special kind of a set of ordered pairs&mdash;a
  special type of relation.)
<p>

<p>
  This may be something you have studied before, but, as it is pretty simple
  to explain, I'll give a full treatment here.  The context is the concept
  of an ordered pair of real numbers, such as
  \[
    (2, -1)
  \]
  But the further context is that these ordered pairs might either represent
  the input/output pairs associated with a function (which, as discussed
  in the section on
  <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='function_notation') }}">
    Function Notation
  </a> is a set of ordered pairs).
  Or they might be members of the set of all pairs that satisfy (make true)
  and equation that involve \(x\) and \(y\).
  For instance, consider the equation
  \[
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
  \]
  Imagine the set of all \((x,y)\)-pairs that make this equation true.
  For instance, the pair \((x,y) = (1,0)\) is in this set, since, when
  you let \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\), you get
  \[
    \textrm{LHS} = x^2 + y^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1 = \textrm{RHS}
  \]
  They make the equation true; they "satisfy" the equation!  So, imagine
  the set of <em>all</em> pairs that makes this equation true.  What we consider
  here is what the set "looks" like.  Do you have any idea what I mean by that?
  If you do, imagine what it would be like to be asked that question and
  to have never before learned the concept of a graph.  And if you have no
  idea, just read to the next paragraph.
</p>

<p>
  Having gotten slightly ahead of the discussion, we now need to pause
  and say just exactly how we might visualize a set of ordered pairs&mdash;or,
  for starters, even just a single ordered pair.  The method is basically
  just a form of "charting."  It is something that will be utterly unsurprising
  to you if you have ever done anything related to maps with longitude
  and latitude or even used a table with rows and columns or have every
  played a game of Battleship.  Graphing of ordered pairs happens
  on a chart or playing field that looks like this, but is imagined
  to extend out infinitely:

  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blank.png') }}"
      width="40%">
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  First of all, to understand what you are looking at, what you have here
  is two real lines, one oriented horizontally and the other vertically.
  Where they cross forms the point 0 on <em>both</em> lines.  The grid
  lines are just sort of decorative&mdash;they are there to help you visuallize&mdash;but
  they really don't need to be drawn at all or could be drawn differently.
  Now, when we plot an ordered pair, like
  \[
    (2,-1)
  \]
  we are just going to view it as "instructions" about how far to move from
  0 <em>on both lines</em>.  The first coordinate tells us how far from 0 and
  in what direction we are to move on the <em>horizontal</em> line.  The second coordinate
  tells us how far from 0 and
  in what direction we are to move on the <em>vertical</em> line.
  We plot the unique "point" that coincides with <em>both</em> of these
  instructions.  So, since the first coordinate is \(2\), we imagine moving
  from the 0-point (by the way, it is called <em>the origin</em>
  because that is where you imagine you start) 2 units to the right,
  and because the second coordinate is \(-1\), we imagine
  travelling (additionally) one unit <em>down</em>.  (If the
  first coordinate is negative, you move left, whereas if it is positive,
  you move right.  If the second coordinate is negative, you move down,
  whereas if it is positive you move up.)  Thus, at the end we plot a point&mdash;coinciding
  with both instructions&mdash;like so:

  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/simple_graphing/just_points1.png') }}"
      width="40%">
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  Now, as mentioned above, we will be mainly concerned with the graph of
  a (given) <em>equation</em>.  What does that mean?  For instance, taking
  again the same example as above, you might consider the equation
  \[
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
  \]
  Its graph is <em>the set of all \((x,y)\) pairs that make the equation true.</em>
  Of, you might say, it is a visualization of that set.  So, in other words,
  it is just <em>the solution set</em> of that equation&mdash;or, again,
  really a visualization of it.  So, in that sense, it is "the same" as what
  we did in the section on
  <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='graphsoflinearinequalities') }}">
    real line graphs
  </a>: you shade or draw the points that make the relation true.  One difference
  here is that it takes <em>two</em> values (one for \(x\) and one for \(y\))
  to make the equation true, while when you are graphing on the real line, you
  are only concerned with a single variable, say \(x\).  To elaborate a little further,
  you could also graph the solution to inequalities that involve two variables,
  and you could graph the solution to equations that involve only a single one.
  In the next example, we are just going to explore the basic, fundamental
  concept of a "graph of an equation".  Then, soon enough, we'll start trying
  to figure out to draw the whole graph of certain simple equations.

      Without graphing (by doing an algebraic check),
      tell me whether the following points lie on the graph of the given equation.
    </p>
    <ol class="multi-part" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

          <div class='inner'>
            When you make the substitutions \)x= -1\) and \(y=2\)
            you get that
              \[
              \textrm{LHS} = (x+2)^2 + 1 =  (-1+2)^2 +1 = 1^2 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 = y = \textrm{RHS}
              \]
            So, yes the pair \((-1, 2)\) lies on the graph of the equation.
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>

              \]
            So, no, the pair \((-1, 2)\) does not lie on the graph of the equation.
          </div>

            So, no, the pair \((-1, 2)\) does not lie on the graph of the equation.

<p>
  We now turn to question that will address again and again as we encounter
  new and different equations: How do you know that the graph of an equation is?
  As a warning up front, I want you to know that there is <em>no uniform
    way to figure out what the graph of an equation looks like</em>.  Instead,
    I will advocate different methods depending on the nature of the equation.
    However, what I am saying here isn't totally true  in the sense that
    there is a method that you can always apply and will always help out,
    even if it doesn't efficiently lead you to knowledge of what the graph looks
    like.  I am speaking here of "trial and error".  One thing you can
    always try is to plug in different values for, say, \(x\) and then
    figure out what \(y\) would have to be.  You can then plot the resulting
    value.  I will tend to refer this approach as "just plotting points".
    The only problem with it is that there (typically) an infinite number
    of points to try&mdash;so you really need some other appraoch to know
    <em>for sure</em> what a given graph looks like.  Time to get going on it!
</p>

<p>
  We'll start with one of the easiest ones of all:
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
    We will graph this equation:
    \[
      y = x
    \]
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      We want to draw a picture of the graph of this equation.  But, first
      of all, what does it even mean for a particular graph
      to be <em>the</em> graph of a given equation?
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          The graph of an equation is the set of all \((x, y)\) pairs that makes the
          equation true.  This is example is quite simple, so it is easy
          to see what pairs make it true: every pair like these:
          \[
            (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (-1, -1), (-2, -2), \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\ldots
          \]
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Graph the equation.
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
            Given our observation about what pairs satisfy this equation&mdash;literally,
            every \(x, y\)-pair where the \(x\) is the same as the \(y\)&mdash;it
            hopefully makes sense that it would like like so:

            <div style="text-align:center">
              <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/simple_graphing/line1.png') }}"

        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
  Now, we just alter this equation bit by bit, seeing each change in
  the formula changes the resulting graph.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">

  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->

      </a>
      Give an English description for how \(y\) is related to \(x\)&mdash;being

      about how your description will be reflected in the graph!

          When \(x=0\), \(\y = 0 + 1 = 1\).  Also, for each increase in \(x\),

          In terms of the visual,
          our description means that the graph will be a straight line.
          The fact that "for each increase in \(x\),
          \(y\) will increase by the same amount" means that
          proportional
          changes in \(x\) lead to proportional changes in \(y\), which
          makes it a straight line.  Since any two points serve to
          determine a line, we can plot the pair \((0,1)\) and then
          just one more to be certain of getting the correct line.
          Plugging
          in \(x=1\) yields \(y = 1 + 1 = 2\). So,
          you could plot \((1, 2)\), and then trace the straight line

          <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/simple_graphing/line2.png') }}"
              width="40%">
          </div>

          A good observation to make here is that the graph looks the same
          as that of \(y = x\) only "shifted up one unit."
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
  Note that there was nothing special about the adding 1 in the previous example.
  We could have added 3 or 5 or any number whatsoever.  We also could
  have subtracted any number, for that matter.
  So, the general take-away there is that an equation of the form
  \[
    y = x + b
  \]
  will run through the point \((0, b)\) and will then "go up 1 for every
  1 you run to the right in the \(x\)-direction", following a straight-line course.
  Since the point \((0,b)\) lies on the \(y\)-axis, it is called the
  <em>\(y\)-intercept</em>.  That is, it represents where the line
  "intercepts" or intersects the \(y\)-axis.
</p>

<p>
  Now, we change the equation \(y = x\) in a slightly different way.
