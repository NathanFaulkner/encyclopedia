  In the section on
  <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='simplegraphing') }}">
    simple graphing
  </a>, we practiced developing an equation for a line based
  on its \(y\)-intercept and slope.  But you can develop an equation for a
  line based on other information, too.  The next scenario we consider is
  where you know the slope and one point that the line passes through.
</p>

<p>
  Note that if you know a point a line passes through, and you know its slope,
  then you can draw it!  Put another way, there is only one line with that
  property (which is a more clear way of saying "a point and the slope
  <em>determine</em> the line").
  The question is how to find an equation for it.
  Still, let's first practice just graphing a line based on information
  about a point it passes through and its slope.
<p>



  <p>
  <div class="example">
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
    <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
    </p>

    <p>
      Graph the line that passes through the point \( (2, -4) \)
      and has slope \( m = \frac{1}{3} \).
    </p>
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          Well, so I plot a point at \((2, -4)\) and then proceed
          out with a slope of \(\frac{1}{3}\).  As discussed
          in the section in which we learned
          <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='simplegraphing') }}">
            "point-slope form"
          </a>,
          slope can be expressed as "rise over run".  That is, you can view it
          as telling you how much \(y\) increases by (or decreases by, if
          slope is negative) when \(x\) increases a given amount.  In particular,
          if you write slope as a fraction, you can observe that \(y\) will
          "rise" (or "fall", if negative) by the amount in the numerator
          of the fraction when \(x\) increases by the amount in the
          denominator.  When I "run" 3 units to the right from \((2, -4)\)
          and then "rise" 1 unit, I end up at the point \((5, -3)\).
          Two points are all you need to graph a line, so I'm done:
          <div style="text-align:center">
          {% set svg_id = 'svg1' %}
          {% set points = [[2,-4], [5, -3]]%}
          {% set poly_points = '0.0,315.000000000000 350.0,198.333333333333 ' %}
          {% set parameters = {
              'svg_x_length': 350,
              'svg_y_length': 350,
              'cart_x_min': -10,
              'cart_x_max': 10,
              'cart_x_length': 20,
              'cart_y_min': -10,
              'cart_y_max': 10,
              'cart_y_length': 20
            }
          %}
          {% include "_static_graph.html" %}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</p>


<p>
  Now, let's talk about how to obtain an equation for this graph.
  One method is try to figure out what the \(y\)-intercept is.
  While that method is okay, there is another method.
  Once you learn this other method, it will be easier
  than the method of finding the \(y\)-intercept.
</p>

<p>
  Let me demonstrate the method, then I'll explain it, then you can practice it.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
    Find an equation for the line that passes through the
    point \((1, -3)\) and has slope \(m = \frac{1}{3}\).
  </p>
    <div class="answer">
      <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
      <div class='inner'>
        You can readily verify that \((x,y) = (1,-3)\) will satisfy the equation
        \[
          y = \frac{1}{3}\left(x-1\right)-3
        \]
        (Just plug in those values!!  Don't they make the equation true?
        Do you see why I have placed the '-1' and the '-3' just so?)
        Also, you can easily imagine that if you distributed the
        \(\frac{1}{3}\) in and combined like terms you would soon have
        an equation of the form \(y = mx + b\)&mdash;and the slope would be
        \(m=\frac{1}{3}\).
        So, it is evident without doing any real work that the equation
        above will have a graph with the correct slope and will pass
        through the given point.  Therefore it is an equation of the graph described.
      </div>
    </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>
  Here's another example without all of the talk.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
    Find an equation for the line that passes through the
    point \((2, 5)\) and has slope \(m = -\frac{3}{4}\).
  </p>
    <div class="answer">
      <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
      <div class='inner'>
        \[
          y = -\frac{3}{4}\left(x-2\right)+5
        \]
      </div>
    </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>
  I am using what is called <em>point-slope form</em> here.

  <blockquote>
      An equation in the form
        \[
          y = m(x-x_0) + y_0
        \]
      is said to be in <b>point-slope form</b>.
      In this generic equation, \(x\) and \(y\)
      are the variables, whereas \(m\), \(x_0\), and \(y_0\)
      will be numbers specified in each problem.
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  As I demonstrated in my example above, you can just "read off"
  the fact that the substitution of \(x=x_0\) and \(y=y_0\)
  will make the equation true.  If \(x = x_0\) and \(y=y_0\), then
    \[
      \textrm{RHS} = m(x-x_0) + y_0 = m(x_0-x_0)+y_0  = m\cdot 0 + y_0 = 0 + y_0 = y_0 = y = \textrm{LHS}
    \]
  Therefore the graph of this equation passes through \(( x_0, y_0) \).
  You can also tell that it will have the correct slope, since it can be
  put into \( y=mx+b \) form and retain the given slope:
    \[
      y = m(x-x_0) + y_0 = mx - mx_0 + y_0
    \]
  (This means that your \(y\)-intercept would be \(-mx_0+y_0\).)
</p>

<p>
  Now, to contrast, there is another bit of important vocabulary to know:
  <blockquote>
  An equation in the form
    \[
      y = mx + b
    \]
  is said to be in <b>slope-intercept form</b>.
  </blockquote>
