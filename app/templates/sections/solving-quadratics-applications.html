  What is the point of solving a quadratic equation?
  In this section, we'll partially answer that question
  by looking at some applications of quadratics.  For context,
  when I say "solve a quadratic", I mean that you are to solve an equation
  that is equivalent to one of the form
    \[
      ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    \]
  where \(a\neq 0\), \(b\), and \(c\) are given real numbers and \(x\) is the unknown.

  After rounding the results of some intermediate calculations that are not displayed
  here, the vertical height \(y\) above the ground of a cannonball shot
  from an initial height of \(28\) feet with an initial velocity
  of \(334\) feet per second and initial launch angle
  (measured from the ground) of \(23^\circ\)
  can be given as a function of the horizontal distance
  \(x\) it has traveled from the launching point
  (if we neglect air resistance and the coriolis effect!) by
  \[
      y(x) = -0.00017x^2 + 0.424x + 28
  \]
  Find the horizontal distance \(x\) away from the launching point at
  which the cannonball crashes to Earth.

    <div class='inner'>
      The cannonball crashes to earth when the vertical height, \(y\) is \(0\).
      So, we just set \(y=0\) and solve.  That is,w e need to solve the equation
        \[
        -0.00017x^2 + 0.424x + 28 = 0
        \]
      Just use the quadratic formula:
        \begin{align*}
          x & = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\
          & = \frac{ -0.424 \pm \sqrt{(0.424)^2 - 4(-0.00017)(28)}}{2(-0.00017)} \\
          x & \approx -64.376 \quad  \textrm{or}
           \quad x \approx 2558.494
        \end{align*}
      Now, since we are interested in the cannonball hitting the ground beyond our
      target (rather than behind it!) we select the positive answer.
      As a challenge, you should contemplate what the negative answer represents;
      it isn't meaningless!

      So, the final answer is \(x \approx 2558.494\) ft.

  In some cultures it is common to celebrate a holiday or special event by
  firing bullets into the air.  According to Wikipedia,
  "It is culturally accepted in parts of the Balkans, parts of Russia,
  the Middle East, the Central Asian country of Afghanistan, and the
  South Asian country of Pakistan."
  <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_gunfire">See
    Wikipedia article, "Celebratory Gunfire".
  </a>
  Of course, this can be a problem&mdash;with bullets returning to Earth and
  sometimes fatally wounding random people&mdas;and thus the practice is
  outlawed in many areas.

  <p>
  A completely accurate model of the path the bullet travels will take
  into account "air resistance" which actually causes the bullet
  as it returns to Earth to reach a ``terminal velocity''
  that is lower than what it was when first leaving the barrel of the gun
  but which is still great enough to kill.
  However, this model involves exponentials and logarithms,
  so we aren't quite ready for it yet.
  Instead, we will model it based off of Newton's law
  of graviation (which is that bodies fall with constant
  acceleration of 32 feet per second, if you neglect air resistance.)
  (The Coriolis Effect also plays a role.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's consider the simple case of when a bullet is fired
  "straight up" in the air, and study how long it takes to come
  back down&mdash;which could at least give party-goers some idea of how
  quickly they need move to a safe distance away after a celebration
  of this kind.  (In reality, it will take a little longer
  since air slows the bullet down, so we will be
  recommending a safe amount of time.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Let's imagine that the bullet leaves the muzzle of a gun at a
  position of 85 inches (let's call it 7.083 feet) from the ground.
  A typical bullet velocity is 2000 feet per second
  (but it varies considerably).
  According to Newton's law of gravitation, the bullet falls to Earth
  (neglecting air resistance) with an acceleration of 32 feet per second
  per second.  (FYI: Acceleration measures the rate of change of the velocity.)
  </p>

  <p>
  All that combines to give you the following model
  for the position $y$ of the bullet relative to the ground after $t$ seconds
    \[
      y(t) = 7.083 + 2000t - 16 t^2
    \]
  (FYI: Where did the `32' go?  It became a 16.)
  </p>

  <p>
  Your task: Figure how quickly the party-goers need to leave the area!!
  </p>

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      We need to solve
        \[
          7.083 + 2000t - 16t^2 = 0
        \]
      Let's use the quadratic formula:
        \[
          t = \frac{}{} = \frac{-2000 \pm \sqrt{2000^2 - 4(-16)(7.083)}}{2(7.083)}
        \]
      which means
        \[
          t \approx {% set when0 = (-2000-(2000**2-4*-16*7.083)**0.5)/(2*-16) %}{{when0|round(3)}}
          \quad\quad \textrm{or} \quad\quad
          t \approx {% set when1 = (-2000+(2000**2-4*-16*7.083)**0.5)/(2*-16) %}{{when1|round(3)}}
        \]
      Now, which do you suppose is the right answer?  Of course, the
      nonnegative one.  Can you make sense of the negative answer?
      Do you know what it represents?

      So, in all, we are recommending that the party-goers clear the area
      {% set when = (-2000-(2000**2-4*-16*7.083)**0.5)/(2*-16) %}
      within about {{when|round(0)}}
      seconds!!  Of course, if the bullet actual was
      fired at an angle rather than straight up, you'd want
      to run in the correct (opposite) direction, too!

  Finally, let's look at an example in which no real solution results:

  </p> -->

  Use the quadratic formula to solve.
  \[
    x^2 + x + 1 = 0
  \]

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      Note that \(a=1\), \(b=1\), and \(c=1\).  So,
        \begin{align*}
          &  x=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \quad \textrm{or} \quad
            x=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad \quad & x = \frac{-1-\sqrt{(1)^2-4\cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} \quad \textrm{or} \quad
          x = \frac{-1+\sqrt{(1)^2-4\cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad \quad & x = \frac{-1-\sqrt{1-4}}{2} \quad \textrm{or} \quad
          x = \frac{-1+\sqrt{1-4}}{2}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad \quad & x = \frac{-1-\sqrt{-3}}{2} \quad \textrm{or} \quad
          x = \frac{-1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\
        \end{align*}
      Note that \(\sqrt{-3}\) can't be a real number because there is no real
      number that multiplies together to give you a negative such as \(-3\).
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  A key observation you need to make is that there will be no real solution
  to a quadratic precisely when the number under the square root symbol
  is negative.  Why?  Well, because the question of a square root
  of a negative number is what real number times itself comes out negative.
  But we know that you cannot multiply any real number times itself
  to yield a negative.  By the way, a "square root sign" is often called
  a "radical".  Really, the word is the same: "radical" means "root"
  as in "radish."
