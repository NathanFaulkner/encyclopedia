  One of the uses that functions are put to is to form "links in a chain."
  We have already discussed functions as machines taking an input and yielding
  an output.  Now, there is nothing stopping us from using the output of one
  function as the input of another machine down the line.  Think of it as
  like an assembly line.  Indeed, you do this all the time when you think
  about "order of operations" questions.
<p>

<p>
  There is some notation and a piece of vocabulary associated with this,
  but first let's look at a picture:

  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/function-composition.png') }}"
      width="80%">
  </div>
</p>









  <p>
  <div class="example">
    <h2></h2>
    <p>
    <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
    </p>

    <p>
      Illustrate the function described as follows in English as two functions
      "joined end-to-end", that is, with one function taking
      the output of the previous as its input:
      <blockquote>
        The first function \(g\) adds one to the input,
        and the second function \(f\) multiplies its input by 5.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/function-machine-composition-example.png') }}"
                width="80%">
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </div>
  </p>

<p>
  When we join functions assembly-line fashion like this, it is called
  <em>composition</em>.  The functions \(g\) and \(f\)
  above have been <em>composed</em>.

  There are different ways to denote composition notationally,
  but let's consider one important way.
  The expression
  \[
  y = f(g(x))
  \]
  is a way of denoting the basic picture we just saw.
  The way you read the expression
  "\(y=f(g(x))\)"
  is "y is f of g of x" and what it means is this:
  the output \(y\) is determined by first taking the input
  \(x\) and plugging it into the function \(g\).
  The resulting output, say \(u=g(x)\), is then plugged into the \(f\) function.
  Look again at the first illustration above.  The scenario described here
  is exactly what is being depicted there!
</p>


<p>
  Let's practice.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
  Let \(f(x) = x - 1\) and \(g(x) = 6x\).  Compute the indicated values.
  </p>



  <ol class="multi-part" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>
      \(f(g(2))\)
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          First I compute the value of \(g(2)\):
          \[
            g(2) = 6\cdot 2 = 12
          \]
          Then I substitute this value in for the symbol \(g(2)\)
          in the expression \(f(g(2))\):
          \[
            f(g(2)) = f(12) = 12 - 1 = 11
          \]
          That's all there is to it!
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      \(f(g(-1))\)
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          First I compute the value of \(g(-1)\):
          \[
            g(-1) = 6\cdot (-1) = -6
          \]
          Then I substitute this value in for the symbol \(g(-1)\)
          in the expression \(f(g(-1))\):
          \[
            f(g(-1)) = f(-6) = -6 - 1 = -7
          \]
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      \(g(f(-1))\)
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          This time, I first compute the value of \(f(-1)\):
          \[
            f(-1) =  -1 - 1 = -2
          \]
          Then I substitute this value in for the symbol \(f(-1)\)
          in the expression \(g(f(-1))\):
          \[
            g(f(-1)) = g(-2) = 6(-2) = -12
          \]
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      \(g(g(2))\)
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          You can also compose a function with itself!  First,
          I compute the value of \(g(2)\):
          \[
            g(2) = 6\cdot 2 = 12
          \]
          Then I substitute this value in for the symbol \(g(2)\)
          in the expression \(g(g(2))\):
          \[
            g(g(2)) = g(12) = 6 \cdot 12 = 72
          \]
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
</p>

  That's pretty much it!  Except there is a just a litle more we could remark on
  here.  Though we don't have much use for it in this class, there is a
  symbol for composition.  You see, composition involves a combination
  of functions.  In this way it is like addition or multiplication&mdash;which
  involve a combination of numbers.  So, just as the addition and
  multiplication <em>operations</em> have symbols, the operation of
  composition also gets a symbol.  Here it is: \(\circ\).  So, the expression
  \(f \circ g\) is given meaning by the following rule:
  \[
    (f \circ g) (x) = f(g(x))
  \]
  The one reason I point this out is that&mdash;once you have this analogy
  drawn from composition to addition and multiplication&mdash;it leads you to
  ask the natural question: is function composition <em>commutative</em>
  like addition and multiplication are?  That is, as you know, for any real
  numbers \(a\) and \(b\), you have
  \begin{align*}
    a + b &= b + a & \textrm{(Commutativity of Addition)}
  \end{align*}
  So, is it true that for all functions \(f\) and \(g\), \(f\circ g = g \circ f\)?
  The answer is "no", as you can see from the example we just did!  You
  see, we computed both the values of \((f \circ g)(-1)\) and \((g \circ f) (-1) \),
  and they came out different.  Therefore \(f \circ g\) and \(g \circ f\)
  are different functions:
  \[
    f \circ g \not = g \circ f
  \]

  One of the challenges you will face in these exercises is to mind your order
  of operations.  I am assuming a familiarity with these.  But
  let's do one more example for some practice in that direction.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
  Let \(f(x) = 1 - (x -2)^2 \) and \(g(x) = 6|x|\).  Compute the indicated values.
  </p>



  <ol class="multi-part" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>
      \(f(g(2))\)
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          First I compute the value of \(g(2)\):
          \[
            g(2) = 6\cdot |2| = 6 \cdot 2 = 12
          \]
          Then I substitute this value in for the symbol \(g(2)\)
          in the expression \(f(g(2))\):
          \[
            f(g(2)) = f(12) = 1 - (12 - 2)^2 = 1 - 10^2 = 1 - 100 = -99
          \]
          Note how I carry out these operations in a particular order!
          You may be familiar with the mnemonic PEMDAS to help you
          remember this "order of operations".  You carry out the operations
          in the following order:
          <ol>
            <li>First, those inside <b>p</b>arentheses.</li>
            <li>Then, apply <b>e</b>xponents.</li>
            <li>Up next, you carry out <b>m</b>ultiplication/<b>d</b>ivision operations.</li>
            <li>Lastly, you carry out <b>a</b>ddition/<b>s</b>ubtraction.</li>
          </ol>
          One thing this mnemonic omits is how to treat "negation".  For the
          purposes of applying the mnemonic, you can pretend that
          negation is "multiplying by \(-1\)".  However, it is much more correct
          to say that the reverse is true: multiplication by \(-1\) really
          just means negation.  The point concerning order of operations and
          negation, though, is that negation fits into the order
          with multiplication/division.  So, you could adopt the
          adjusted mnemonic "PENDMAS" or "PEMNDAS" or "PEMDNAS"&mdash;whichever
          suits you best&mdash;in case it helps you realize how negation fits in.

          <p>
            You might have some additional questions about whether multiplication
            and division are interchangeable or, similarly, whether addition
            and subtraction are interchangeable in terms of the order of
            operations.  The answer is "yes" provided you understand
            division as "multiplying by a fraction" and subtraction as "adding
            a negative".  But if you view division or subtraction as independent
            operations with independent symbols, then it is possible to run
            into trouble.  Specifically, neither division nor subtraction
            as "associative" which means they cannot be treated as
            freely as multiplication and addition can be.  To see what I mean,
            note that
            \[
              3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5) = 3 \cdot 20 = 60 = 12 \cdot 5 = (3 \cdot 4) \cdot 5
            \]
            This is an illustration of the associativity of multiplication, which,
            together with the commutativity of multiplication, means that
            "you can carry out a product in any order you want".  For instance,
            I could have also done the above product by computing:
            \[
              (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 4 = 15 \cdot 4 = 60
            \]
            Same thing no matter what!
            But this does not work out with division.  Just look here to see
            what I mean:
            \[
              (60 \div 3) \div 2 = 20 \div 2 = 10
            \]
            while
            \[
              60 \div (3 \div 2) = 60 \div 1.5 = 40
            \]
            So, division is not associative!  Subtraction isn't either,
            but I'll leave that to you to prove to yourself.  Moral: PEMDAS
            works, but you may have more thinking to do about it.  Never
            shut off yoru brain in math!  (Don't just naively
            "follow the rules.")
