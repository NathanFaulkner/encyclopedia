  As a combination of two previous sections, we now <em>graph</em> the solutions
  to what you already encountered in solving compound inequalities.  For
  instruction, please consider these examples, which are the same
  that we solved in the section on compound inequalities, though, here we
  graph them.
</p>

<div class="example">

  Consider this very basic compound inequality:
  \[
    x \lt -3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad x \gt 4
  \]

  <ol class="multi-part" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>
      What does it mean?

          This is shorthand for the narrative "\(x\) is a real
          number that is (either) less than \(-3\)
          (to the left of \(-3\), on a horizontal real line)
          <em>or</em> greater than 4". It is critical that we contemplate what this means.

          <p>
            Again, you ought to look at this inequality as a
            "test of membership" in a club.  So, take some
            random real number, like 5.  We test it for membership
            by considering each of the inequalities in the compound
            expression but <em>also</em> carefully processing
            the meaning of the logical connector.  So, is \(x\)
            less than -3? *No*, of course not.  Does that
            mean that \(x\) is out of the club?  No!  That's because
            of the 'or': to be in this "club", 5 only needs to
            meet <em>one</em> of the conditions in the compound
            expression---not both!  So, "and" means "has to satisfy
            both" whereas "or" means "only needs to satisfy
            one of the conditions".  Indeed, as \(5 \gt 4\), 5
            is indeed in the club; it is part of the set defined
            by this compound expression.

            We'll graph this thing on the real line in a moment&mdash;which
            may be of some help to you, but another good visual
            comes in the form of a Venn diagram. Just take a look at

          We need to shade all \(x\)-values to the left of \(-3\) and
          to the right of \(4\),
          also using empty circles for those endpoints.

      It's time to take a step back and consider the underlying narrative
      of the solving process; this is just something we need to do each
      time something new is introduced&mdash;to carefully consider the
      question, "What does it mean?"

      <p>
        In solving, we are first saying, "Suppose there is a real number
        \(x\) with the given property."  In this case, we are imagining
        that if you take 12 away from the product of 3 times \(x\),
        you get something that falls between -3 and 18 but possibly equal to 18.
        Let me point out that the inequalities we are studying in this
        section are called "compound".  That really means that
        they include more than one statement about \(x\)&mdash;added information,
        if you will!&mdash;which are joined together by "logical connectors",
        'and' or 'or'.  See the first two examples for a definition of these.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of this problem, the 'and' connector (which is always
        implied when only a single \(x\) is used&mdash;\(x\) must satisfy
        both statements!) means that <em>both</em>, whatever \(x\)
        ends up being, it the value of \(3x - 12\) must be greater
        than \(-3\) but <em>also</em> less than or equal to \(18\).  So,
        we have two separate inequalities that we can solve in turn:
        \begin{align*}
        &  3x - 12 \gt -3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad 3x-12 \leq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  3x \gt 9 \quad \textrm{and} \quad 3x \leq 30 & \textrm{For each, add 12 to both sides.}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  x \gt 3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x \leq 10 & \textrm{For each, divide both sides by 3.}\\
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, there is a certain amount of redundancy in this process&mdash;in
        that we end up doing the same thing to both sides of <em>each</em>
        inequality at each step.  So, there is a more streamlined way
        of writing this:
      </p>
      \begin{align*}
      & -3 \lt 3x - 12 \leq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & 9 \lt 3x \leq 30 & \textrm{I added 12 to all three columns.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & 3 \lt x \leq 10 & \textrm{I divided all three columns by 3.}\\
      \end{align*}

      <p>
        Now, we graph it.

        {% set svg = 'svg3' %}
        {% set points = [{'x': 3, 'type': 'empty'},
                          {'x': 10, 'type': 'filled'}] %}
        {% set intervals = [[3,10]] %}
        {% include "_static-real-line.html" %}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
    Solve the inequality.  Give your answer both in inequality notation
    and by graphing the solution on a number line.
    \[
       3x - 12 \lt -3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x - 12 \geq 18
    \]
  </p>

  <div class="answer">

    <div class='inner'>
      Of course, this one isn't very different.  I have switched
      the inequalities and changed it to an "or".  (I changed
      it to an "or", so that you get to compare it to
      the previous one; I switched the inequalities
      because otherwise the answer would be rather confusing!
      See future examples for an explanation of what I mean here!)

      <p>
        In the context of this problem, the 'or' connector (which will
        always be explicitly given) means, whatever \(x\)
        ends up being, it will (either) be true that the value of \(3x - 12\)
        will be less
        than \(-3\) <em>or</em> that the value of \(3x - 12\)
        will be greater than or equal to \(18\).  So, again,
        we have two separate inequalities that we can solve in turn:
        \begin{align*}
        &  3x - 12 \lt -3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x - 12 \geq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  3x \lt 9 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x \geq 30 & \textrm{For each, add 12 to both sides.}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  x \lt 3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad x \geq 10 & \textrm{For each, divide both sides by 3.}\\
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, there isn't a ready-made way to streamline this process.
        But maybe you can make one up, if you feel so bold.
      </p>


      <p>
        Now, we graph it.

        {% set svg = 'svg4' %}
        {% set points = [{'x': 3, 'type': 'empty'},
                          {'x': 10, 'type': 'filled'}] %}
