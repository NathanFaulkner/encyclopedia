  This section concerns a skill of sort of "intermediate" importance&mdash;that
  is, we will mostly just use it as a step to something more useful.

  Completely factor the following.
    \[
      x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12
    \]

      Allow me to demonstrate the (new) technique of "factoring by grouping."
      Basically, observe that the first two terms have a factor in common.
      Factor out the GCF!
        \[
          x^3 - 3x^2 = x^2(x-3)
        \]
      Now, the trick will be to get that second factor&mdash;that is, \(x-3\)&mdash;to
      be a factor of the sum of the second two terms (grouped.)
      But, you'll have to factor out a negative to make it happen!
      So, here is what it will look like:
        \[
          x^3 - 3x^2 - 4 x + 12 = x^2(x-3) - 4(x-3)
        \]
      See it?  Now, to "finish the job," you make the observation that
      \((x-3)\) is a common
      factor of both \(x^2(x-3)\) and \(4(x-3)\).  Factor it out.
        \[
          x^2(x-3) - 4(x-3) = (x^2-4)(x-3)
        \]
      Now, it is "factored"&mdash;but mind the directions here!
      It says to "completely factor."
      What does that mean?  It means to first write it as a product (check!)
      But it also means to scrutinize any of the factors to see if they
      could be broken down into yet simpler factors.
      Since \(x^2-4 = (x-2)(x+2)\),
      we have one final step to the final answer, which is
        \[
          (x-2)(x+2)(x-3)
        \]

  Here are a couple more examples without all of the narrative.
</p>

  Completely factor the following.
  \[
    x^3 + 5x^2 + 6x + 30
  \]
  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      \begin{align*}
        x^3 + 5x^2 + 6x + 30 & = x^2(x+5) + 6(x+5) \\
        & = (x^2+6)(x+5)
      \end{align*}
      Since we don't have any tools for factoring \(x^2+6\) we can stop there.

  Completely factor the following.
  \[
    4x^3 - 6x^2 + 6x - 9
  \]
  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      \begin{align*}
        4x^3 - 6x^2 + 6x - 9  &= 2x^2(2x-3) +3(2x-3)\\
        &= (2x^2+3)(2x-3)
      \end{align*}
      Since we don't know how to factor \(2x^2+3\) we'll stop there.
