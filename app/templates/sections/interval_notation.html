  In this section, we learn a handy way of <em>symbolizing</em> the
  set of all solutions to a linear inequality or to a compound
  inequality&mdash;as well as many other types of equations or systems.
  While a graph is certainly a way to represent these solution sets&mdash;and
  inequality notation (together with logical connectors "and" and "or")
  is yet another way&mdash;we learn this third way, called <em>interval notation</em>
  in this one.  Why do we need a third way of representing these sets?
  It is for two reasons: For one, interval notation is compact; it takes
  little effort to write it in comparison with a graph. It will also be without
  the potential ambiguity or imprecision of a drawing.  But what
  advantage does it have over inequality notation?  Inequality notation
  consists in statements about \(x\).  As such, it represents complete
  sentences or at least grammatical fragments of one depending on one's intention.
  As we have noted, sometimes the "secret narrative" is not expressed in
  math textbooks, leaving inequality possibly unclear to the reader.  Interval notation,
  on the other hand, is much simpler.  Its meaning is completely clear cut: What we will
  be devising in this section is symbols for <em>nouns</em>&mdash;for the objects
  themselves&mdash;the solution sets, which, really, will involve quite a bit less
  grammar and not potential for ambiguity.
</p>

<h3>What is an Interval?</h3>
<p>
  An interval basically consists in (1) a left endpoint, (2) a right endpoint,
   and (3) ``everything in between''---that is, all <em>intervening</em> values.
   However, since \(-\infty\) and \(\infty\) are allowed as endpoints of an
   interval (which is a funny way of saying the interval is missing an endpoint),
   it can be more straightforward to say that an interval is a subset of the
   real line that has no breaks in it.
   But my first description with the (1), (2), (3) will help you understand a special notation for intervals (called interval notation).

  We'll take a look at interval notation, but, first, I have just referred to invervals as subsets of the real line.  Now what does that mean?  What are ``sets'' or ``subsets'' in math?  If you don't know, just ask me (or your neighbor or the Internet---but please ask me if none of the answers you get make sense.)

  Interval notation works like this: you write the endpoints (possibly $-\infty$ or $\infty$) in order, left to right, separated by a comma.  Then you surround that pair of numbers with some combination of parentheses or (square) brackets.  Which you use depends on whether or not the endpoint is included in the interval or not (it may or may not be).  Use a parenthesis next to  an endpoint that is not included and a brace next to an endpoint that \emph{is} included.  By convention, $-\infty$ and $\infty$ are never ``included'' (because ``you never get there.'')
</p>

<p>
  It makes sense to start with a very basic one,
  so we can discuss the underlying meaning, before we start adding in the
  task of solving, don't you think?

          This is shorthand for the narrative "\(x\) is a real
          number that is greater than \(-3\)
          (to the right of \(-3\), on a horizontal real line)
          <em>and</em> less than 4".  In fact, there is another
          important way that you can represent this statement
          (which you will have to use when answering the
          exercises, because of the way I programmed
          the answer-checking algorithm).  This inequality
          can also be written
          \[
            x \gt -3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x \lt 4
          \]

          <p>
            The use of the word "and" is critical here.
            Actually, let me tell you that the most important
            concepts in this section are those represented by
            the words "and" and "or".  The meaning and concept behind these
            words is a fundamental aspect of logic, which pervades not only
            mathematics but computer programming and philosophy and
            other systems of logic.  We need to contemplate their meaning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, while you are, of course, familiar with the English words "and"
            and "or", this is math (and computer science and philosophy at the
            same time).  You might think that's a bad thing&mdash;but I know
            you are also familiar with one of the strengths of math expression
            over-and-above common English.  Or, maybe you are just beginning to
            understand the key strength (and, at the same time, limitation)
            of math: everything in math has a very precise, defined meaning (and
            anything not expressible in such terms is not amenable to mathematical
            reasoning.)  In point of fact, the English words "and" and "or"
            carry some ambiguity in this and other contexts&mdash;an ambiguity which
            must be allayed by our careful definition of these words.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let me define the logical connector 'and' first by talking about
            in the context of the compound inequality above.  The inequality
            \[
              x \gt -3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x \lt 4
            \]
            should really be understood as describing or defining a set
            of real numbers&mdash;the set of real numbers that satisfies
            it (that make it a true statement when plugged in for \(x\)).
            Think of this set as a "club" and this expression as the
            means by which you decide whether a number is member or not;
            it is a <em>test</em> of membership.  So, take some random
            real number, like 5.  So, you test it against the
            criteria (with that special logical connector): you first observe
            that *yes* \(5 \gt -3\).  However, it must have both that
            property <em>and</em> the next; it must also be less than 4.
            It isn't, so it is not a member of this set.  This is pretty
            easy stuff, but you will want to compare this to
            what I say about the connector 'or' n the next example!
          </p>

          <p>
            Maybe the best way to realize the meaning is to shade on a real line
            where \(x\) could possibly be, as in the next question.

          This is shorthand for the narrative "\(x\) is a real
          number that is (either) less than \(-3\)
          (to the left of \(-3\), on a horizontal real line)
          <em>or</em> greater than 4". It is critical that we contemplate what this means.

          <p>
            Again, you ought to look at this inequality as a
            "test of membership" in a club.  So, take some
            random real number, like 5.  We test it for membership
            by considering each of the inequalities in the compound
            expression but <em>also</em> carefully processing
            the meaning of the logical connector.  So, is \(x\)
            less than -3? *No*, of course not.  Does that
            mean that \(x\) is out of the club?  No!  That's because
            of the 'or': to be in this "club", 5 only needs to
            meet <em>one</em> of the conditions in the compound
            expression---not both!  So, "and" means "has to satisfy
            both" whereas "or" means "only needs to satisfy
            one of the conditions".  Indeed, as \(5 \gt 4\), 5
            is indeed in the club; it is part of the set defined
            by this compound expression.

  <div class="answer">

    <div class='inner'>
      It's time to take a step back and consider the underlying narrative
      of the solving process; this is just something we need to do each
      time something new is introduced&mdash;to carefully consider the
      question, "What does it mean?"

      <p>
        In solving, we are first saying, "Suppose there is a real number
        \(x\) with the given property."  In this case, we are imagining
        that if you take 12 away from the product of 3 times \(x\),
        you get something that falls between -3 and 18 but possibly equal to 18.
        Let me point out that the inequalities we are studying in this
        section are called "compound".  That really means that
        they include more than one statement about \(x\)&mdash;added information,
        if you will!&mdash;which are joined together by "logical connectors",
        'and' or 'or'.  See the first two examples for a definition of these.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the context of this problem, the 'and' connector (which is always
        implied when only a single \(x\) is used&mdash;\(x\) must satisfy
        both statements!) means that <em>both</em>, whatever \(x\)
        ends up being, it the value of \(3x - 12\) must be greater
        than \(-3\) but <em>also</em> less than or equal to \(18\).  So,
        we have two separate inequalities that we can solve in turn:
        \begin{align*}
        &  3x - 12 \gt -3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad 3x-12 \leq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  3x \gt 9 \quad \textrm{and} \quad 3x \leq 30 & \textrm{For each, add 12 to both sides.}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  x \gt 3 \quad \textrm{and} \quad x \leq 10 & \textrm{For each, divide both sides by 3.}\\
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, there is a certain amount of redundancy in this process&mdash;in
        that we end up doing the same thing to both sides of <em>each</em>
        inequality at each step.  So, there is a more streamlined way
        of writing this:
      </p>
      \begin{align*}
      & -3 \lt 3x - 12 \leq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & 9 \lt 3x \leq 30 & \textrm{I added 12 to all three columns.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & 3 \lt x \leq 10 & \textrm{I divided all three columns by 3.}\\
      \end{align*}

      <p>
        Now, we graph it.

        {% set svg = 'svg3' %}
        {% set points = [{'x': 3, 'type': 'empty'},
                          {'x': 10, 'type': 'filled'}] %}
        {% set intervals = [[3,10]] %}
        {% include "_static-real-line.html" %}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
    Solve the inequality.  Give your answer both in inequality notation
    and by graphing the solution on a number line.
    \[
       3x - 12 \lt -3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x - 12 \geq 18

      Of course, this one isn't very different.  I have switched
      the inequalities and changed it to an "or".  (I changed
      it to an "or", so that you get to compare it to
      the previous one; I switched the inequalities
      because otherwise the answer would be rather confusing!
      See future examples for an explanation of what I mean here!)

      <p>
        In the context of this problem, the 'or' connector (which will
        always be explicitly given) means, whatever \(x\)
        ends up being, it will (either) be true that the value of \(3x - 12\)
        will be less
        than \(-3\) <em>or</em> that the value of \(3x - 12\)
        will be greater than or equal to \(18\).  So, again,
        we have two separate inequalities that we can solve in turn:
        \begin{align*}
        &  3x - 12 \lt -3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x - 12 \geq 18 & \textrm{Given}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  3x \lt 9 \quad \textrm{or} \quad 3x \geq 30 & \textrm{For each, add 12 to both sides.}\\
        \Rightarrow \quad &  x \lt 3 \quad \textrm{or} \quad x \geq 10 & \textrm{For each, divide both sides by 3.}\\
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, there isn't a ready-made way to streamline this process.
        But maybe you can make one up, if you feel so bold.
      </p>

        Now, we graph it.
