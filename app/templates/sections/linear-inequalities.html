  In this section, we solve basic inequalities.  You will see in the title
  of this section that these can be classified as "linear" inequalities.
  What does that mean?  It isn't terribly important to discuss here, but
  we will in a later section.
</p>

<p>
  So, how does one go about solving these?  You may already know, and you
  may be a in a rush to just jump into the exercises.  But let me warn you---naively
  approaching inequalities will quickly (in subsequent sections) lead you to
  a misconception and to a struggle to master these topics.  It can be hard
  to unlearn mistaken ideas, sometimes!  The key here (and to all of math)
  is <em>to think about the meaning of each statement.</em>
  So, consider with me the "meaning of it all"!
</p>

<p>
  Firstly&mdash;and I'll try to be quick, because you may very well already know these
  basic facts&mdash;let's run through the meaning of the four
  inequality symbols we will be using, \(\lt\), \(\gt\), \(\leq\), and
  \(\geq.\) The symbol \(\lt\) is called "less than" and is used to indicate
  that the number lying to its left is "less than" the number to its right.  Even better, you
  ought to get in the habit of imagining a real line oriented horizontally.
  In that setting "less than" is better expressed as "to
  the left of".  For instance,
  \[
    x \lt 5
  \]
  means that "\(x\)" is a real number&mdash;so, a number you could plot on the
  real line&mdash; lying somewhere to the left of 5.  But, aside from that,
  we really don't know what \(x\) is from this statement: \(x\) could
  be 4 or it could be -4,000,000,000.
</p>

<p>
  We can also use inequality signs together only with numbers.  For instance,
  \[
    4 \lt 5
  \]
  is a true statement, whereas
  \[
    6 \lt 5
  \]
  is a false statement!  Actually, you might observe that, concerning the
  statement
  \[
    x \lt 5
  \]
  you might not know if it is true or false&mdash;because you don't know
  what \(x\) is!  The statement might be true or it might be false
  depending on what \(x\) is.  In fact, when you see an expression
  involving a variable such as this one, as we will also discuss below,
  there is really a secret narrative that helps one know whether it is
  a true statement or a false one.  For instance, if, as below, someone says
  <blockquote>
    Solve for \(x\):
    \[
      3x - 7 \lt 8
    \]
  </blockquote>
  what they are really saying, first of all, is "Suppose that \(x\) is
  a real number with the property that \(3x - 7 \lt 8\)", which
  means that they are asking you to assume the statement is true&mdash;or
  at least you make the assumption that it is true as your first
  step in the solving process.  In those cases where the solving process
  results in "no solution", what is really happening is that it turns
  out that the original statement was false or impossible.  To let you
  in on a further secret, the way a mathematician would fully,
  precisely narrate the initial statement of the given is to say "There
  exists a real number \(x\) with the property that \(3x - 7 \lt 8\)."
  If, in the course of making valid deductions, one arrives at a contradictory
  statement, such as "\(6 \lt 4\)", then one would know that the original
  supposition was false; instead, one would conclude "There does not exist any real
  number \(x\) with the property that \(3x - 7 \lt 8\)".
</p>

<p>
  The symbol, \(\leq\) is read "less than or equal to" and means that
  the number to its left is less than or equal to
  the number to its right.  For instance,
  \[
    4 \leq 5
  \]
  is a true statement (since 4 is less than 5), and&mdash;per the "or equal to" part&mdash;so is
  \[
    5 \leq 5
  \]
  since 5 is equal to 5.
</p>

<p>
  Now, take my advice, and start this business of making sense of inequalities
  by imagining a real line oriented horizontally in your mind's eye
   and then remarking that "less than" <em>really means</em> "to the left of"
   while "greater than" <em>really means</em> "to the right of".  This will help
   you avoid confusion as you consider an inequality like the following:
   \[
    -4 \leq -5
   \]
   Is this a true statement or a false one?  Don't be fooled!  Even though
   -4 has a smaller <em>magnitude</em> (or "bigness"&mdash;I'm really
   talking about how far it is from 0&mdash;as in it is a smaller
   distance away) it is "greater than" -5&mdash;because it lies
   to the right of -5 on the horizontally-oriented real line.  As you
   probably already know (I am assuming) the negative numbers
   get "bigger" as they head out to the left whereas the positive
   numbers get bigger as they head right&mdash;but, again, this "bigness"
   is <em>not</em> what is being analyzed when we consider "less than"
   and "greater than" inequalities!  Instead, it is better understood
   as "to the left of" or "to the right of" on the horizontal real line.
</p>

<p>
  One final preliminary remark before we start considering some problems
  to work.  There are a number of other inequality symbols
  that we might devise, and which we might use occasionally, the negations:
  <blockquote>
    \(\not=\), \(\not \lt\), \(\not \gt\), \(\not \leq\), \(\not \geq\),
  </blockquote>
  The slash means "not".  So, for instance,
  \[
    6 \not \lt 5
  \]
  is read "6 is not less than 5".  And, of course, that is a true statement!
  On the other hand,
  \[
    5 \not= 5
  \]
  is a false statement.

  Imagine now you are on problem #1, section #2 of your math textbook
  and it says this:
  <blockquote>
    Solve for \(x\):
    \[
      3x - 7 \lt 8
    \]
  </blockquote>

  <ol class="multi-part" type="a">
    <li> What does this mean?
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          As we learned in
          <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='solveforx') }}">
            the section on linear inequalities
          </a>
          there is a "secret narrative" behind such deceptively brief prompts as
          "Solve."  The narrative ought to be expressed thusly:

          <blockquote>
            Suppose that \(x\) is a real number (so, could be plotted
            on the real line) with the property that if you subtract
            7 from 3 times that number it comes out to be less than 8.
            This is properly regarded as an indirect description of
            a <em>set</em> of numbers.  Your job when told to "solve"
            is to find a clear, direct description of this set.
          </blockquote>

          Put another way, we are looking for the set of all real numbers
          that makes the inequality true---or, as mathematicians would put it,
          that <em>satisfy</em> the inequality.  (By the way, you might
          wonder whether there is a word that encompasses both equations
          and inequalities; an appropriate word is "relation.")  The set
          of solutions is, of course, called the "solution set".
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Does 4 satisfy the inequality?
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          Yes, it does!  After all, if \(x = 4\), then
          \[
            \textrm{LHS} = 3x - 7 = 3 \cdot 4 - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \lt 8 = \textrm{RHS},
          \]
          where, again, I am using "LHS" to represent the left-hand side
          and "RHS" to represent the right-hand side.
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Does 5 satisfy the inequality?
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          No, it doesn't.  After all, if \(x = 5\), then
          \[
            \textrm{LHS} = 3x - 7 = 3 \cdot 5 - 7 = 15 - 7 = 8 \not\lt 8 = \textrm{RHS}.
          \]
          So, as you can see, there are some real numbers that are part of the
          solution set and some that are not!
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Go ahead and solve for \(x\).  That is, find a clear, direct description
      of the solution set.
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          \begin{align*}
          & 3x-7 \lt 8 & \textrm{Given}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad & 3x \lt 15 & \textrm{I added 7 to both sides.}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad & x \lt 5 & \textrm{I divided both sides by 3.}\\
          \end{align*}

          Again, there is a narrative behind all of this:

          <blockquote>
            The narrative begins by supposing that \(x\) is a real number.
            If that's the case, then \(3x-7\) is a real number, too.  Indeed,
            we are given that \(3x-7\) is less than 8.
            What real number it is, we do not know.  All we know
            is that it is less than 8!  The number symbolized as
            \(3x-7\) might be 5 or might be \(-1,000\).
            But no matter what it is, we know that if we add 7 to it, then
            its value will not exceed what we'd get if we added 7 to 8, no?
            In math symbols:
            \begin{align*}
            & 3x-7 \lt 8 \\
            \Rightarrow \quad & 3x - 7 + 7 \lt 8 + 7\\
            \Rightarrow \quad & 3x \lt 15\\
            \end{align*}
            (Picturing all of this on the real line is key!  Sorry that
            I don't yet have some handy visuals on this page!)
            Similarly, we next reason that if \(3x\) is some number less than
            (to the left of) \(15\) on the number line, then dividing this
            number by 3 will result in a number that is to the left of 15 divided
            by 3.  Thus, we learn that---whatever the real number \(x\) is, which
            we really cannot know---it is less than 5.  Since \(x\) was arbitrary
            to begin with, we thus reason that <em>any</em> real number \(x\)
            that satisfies this inequality must be less than 5.  Since, too,
            we can "run these steps backwards", we also know that any
            real number \(x\) that is less than 5 will also have the given
            property.  That means that the solution set is
            "the set of all real numbers that are less than 5."
          </blockquote>
          Of course, you aren't expected to give such extensive narratives
          (though it might be good for you).  Instead, you are invited
          to communicate your answer by printing the symbols "\(x \lt 5\)".
          This is your description of the solution set.  In subsequent
          sections, though, we will use other ways of representing this set.

<p>
  Of course, you might be saying to yourself right now that I am making out of
  something very easy something now overly complicated.  On the other hand,
  you might also be aware of the fact that there is a subtle change
  in "the rules" when you go from solving equations to inequalities: there is
  something about "dividing by a negative", you might recall.  So, we need
  to consider an example.
</p>


<div class="example">

  <p>
    Solve the inequality.  That is, give a clear, direct description of its solution set.
    \[
      - 12 x - 6 \lt - 8 x
    \]
  </p>

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      \begin{align*}
      & - 12 x - 6 \lt - 8 x & \textrm{Given}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & - 4 x - 6 \lt 0 & \textrm{I added \(8x\) to both sides.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & -4x \lt 6 & \textrm{I added 6 to both sides.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & x \gt \frac{6}{-4} & \textrm{I divided both sides by -4.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & x \gt -\frac{3}{2} & \textrm{I simplified.}\\
      \end{align*}

      <p>
        Look out!  Do you see what "happened" at that last step where I "divided by -4"?
        The inequality sign "reversed"---from "less than" to "greater than".
        Now, let's get away from this passive talk
        and get right to the meat of it: why did I do that?  What is the logic here?
        What is the meaning of it all?  (The alternative is to just passively accept
        that "that's just the way things are."  There is much to say about this attitude
        toward math, and I'm very sorry if your past experience in the subject
        has led you to its temptations!  I promise a much richer life if you reject
        that stance on things as soon as possible!)
      </p>

      <p>
        To find out why "the inequality reversed", we go through the narrative step-by-step.
        It begins with the
        assumption that \(x\) is a real number---so, it can be located
        on the real line somewhere!  For that matter, \(-12x  - 6\) and
        \(-8x\) are thus also real numbers located somewhere on the real line
        (The positions of \(-12x  - 6\) and \(-8x\), you will do well to conceptualize,
        are determined by wherever \(x\) is and the actions of, for instance,
        multiplying by 12, changing to negative, and then subtracting 6. You will do
        very well for yourself if you imagine what all of those actions do to a number!
        For instance, you might pick some random number for \(x\), like 5, plotting it
        on the real line, and then perform all those actions to it.  If you can
        do that, you have a good understanding of everything.  If you can't, you don't.
        Again, accept my apologies for the lack of visuals or interactives
        on this page at present!)
        So, aside from the fact that everything in sight is a number, the
        other thing we know (are given) is that the number \(-12x - 6\)
        is less than---that is, <em>to the left of</em>---the number \(-8x\).

        But we can also reason about what happens when we do various things to these
        numbers.  Imagine some number \({\color{red}A}\) and some number
        \({\color{blue}B}\) with
        \[
          {\color{red}A} \lt {\color{blue}B}
        \]
        That is, imagine that \({\color{red}A}\) is to the left of
        \({\color{blue}B}\) somewhere.  (You will do very well to sketch
        this on paper or at least---or maybe veen better!---sketch it
        in your mind!)  Of course, that is the very situation we are considering
        here.  You can regard \({\color{red}A} = {\color{red}-12x  - 6}\) and
        \({\color{blue}B} = {\color{blue}-8x}\).  Now, what happens
        when you <em>add</em> any number to both these numbers?  Well, if you add
        a positive number \({\color{orange}C}\) to a number \({\color{red}A}\),
        then you get a new number \({\color{red}A} + {\color{orange}C}\)---which is
        \({\color{red}A}\)
        <em>shifted \({\color{orange}C}\) units to the right</em>.
        Of course, when you add \({\color{orange}C}\) to \({\color{blue}B}\) it
        too shifts to the right \({\color{orange}C}\) units.  So, since
        adding \({\color{orange}C}\) to both \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\)
        shifts them the same amount---"in formation"---you know that
        if \({\color{red}A}\) is to the left of \({\color{blue}B}\)
        before adding \({\color{orange}C}\) then that order
        won't change after adding \({\color{orange}C}\).  In math symbols,
        \begin{align*}
          {\color{red}A} & \lt {\color{blue}B} \\
          \Rightarrow \quad {\color{red}A} + {\color{orange}C} &\lt
           {\color{blue}B} + {\color{orange}C}
        \end{align*}
        Now \({\color{red}A}\), \({\color{blue}B}\), and \({\color{orange}C}\)
        were completely arbitrary---except that we said we'd imagine \({\color{orange}C}\)
        to be positive---so we can see that this will be true no matter what!
        What id \({\color{orange}C}\) is negative?  Well, adding a negative number
        (AKA, subtracting) to \({\color{red}A}\) shifts it to the left
        on the real line, does it not?  So, that doesn't make a big
        difference in everything we just considered.  Thus, we an conclude
        that it is "adding a number to both sides of an inequality
        does not change the direction of the inequality".  Do you see what
        I mean?  In particular, even though we don't know what the number
        \({\color{orange}C} = {\color{orange}8x}\) is, we know that if we add it both
        \({\color{red}A} = {\color{red}-12x  - 6}\) and
        \({\color{blue}B} = {\color{blue}-8x}\)
        the "direction" of the inequality does not change:
        \begin{align*}
          {\color{red}-12x - 6} & \lt {\color{blue}-8x} \\
          \Rightarrow \quad {\color{red}-12x - 6} + {\color{orange}8x}
          & \lt {\color{blue}-8x} + {\color{orange}8x}\\
          \Rightarrow \quad -4x - 6 & \lt 0 \
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, next we can add 6 to both sides without switching the
        inequality, deducing that
        \[
          -4x \lt 6
        \]
        And next comes the subtle part.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of speaking of "dividing by a negative number", I am going
        to narrate this differently.  You see, we are in the business
        here of giving meaning to math---and, you may be pleased to find
        that I regard "dividing by a negative number" as without meaning
        on its own; rather, it is better to conceive it---in this discussion
        of taking actions on points on the real line---as <em>two separate</em>
        actions: the act of negation (of taking the negative of both sides)
        and then the act of dividing by plain, old 4.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, what happens when you have real numbers
        \[
          {\color{red}A} \lt {\color{blue}B}
        \]
        and you take the negative of both sides?  All you have to
        do is to draw a picture!  Pick two "random" points on the real line
        \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\) on the real line
        with \({\color{red}A}\) to the left of \({\color{blue}B}\).  It
        doesn't matter where these are, and, really, it is better if
        you don't bother with adding a bunch of tick marks---except those for
        \({\color{red}A}\), for \({\color{blue}B}\), and fpr one more point
        which is relevant to the concept of negation, 0.  What
        happens (on the real line) when you take the negative of a number like
        \({\color{red}A}\)?  What if \({\color{red}A}\) is positive; what if
        \({\color{red}A}\) is negative?  As you may know, "the negative
        of a negative is a positive" and "the negative of a positive is negative".
        On the real line, we see the whole point of this: negation is
        just about <em>swithing the direction of travel</em>.  After all,
        if you can travel to the east (to the righ on the real line), then
        sometimes you might want to travel west instead, no?  The real number
        system is one that <em>has been devised</em> to represent and
        manage traveling in two different directions in one-dimensional space
        like a line---or a road, for that matter!
      </p>

      <p>
        After consulting your picture, hopefully, you will see that after
        taking the negatives of \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\)
        <em>their order reverses</em>.  You might even try this experiment
        again, starting with \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\)
        in different positions relative to 0 (what happens if both
        \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\) are positive? what
        happens if \({\color{red}A}\)is negative and \({\color{blue}B}\) is positive?
        what happens if \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B}\) are both negative?)
        Thus,
        \begin{align*}
           {\color{red}A} & \lt {\color{blue}B} \\
          \Rightarrow \quad  -{\color{red}A} & \gt
           -{\color{blue}B}
        \end{align*}
        In particular,
        \begin{align*}
           {\color{red}-4x} & \lt {\color{blue}6} \\
          \Rightarrow \quad  -({\color{red}-4x}) & \gt
           -{\color{blue}6} \\
          \Rightarrow \quad 4x & \gt -6
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>
        The final step isn't so complicated.  We divide both sides by 4.
        What happens to two numbers \({\color{red}A} < {\color{blue}B}\)
        when we divide both by 4?  Well, again, you should try drawing
        a picture of this: they both are pushed 75% closer to 0, you could say.
        That is, the distance of the new numbers is one quarter
        to 0 of the distance of \({\color{red}A}\) and \({\color{blue}B} \),
        respectively.  In particular, the order of these two new
        numbers doesn't change.  Thus (we don't switch the inequality
        because of dividing by 4), we get
        \[
          x \gt \frac{-6}{4} = -\frac{3}{2}
        \]

  Now, you might not need any more instruction on this, but it won't hurt
  for me to demo one more problem---one that is a little harder---while
  also skipping most of the narrative.

    Solve the inequality.  That is, give a clear, direct description of its solution set.
    \[
      - 7 \left(x - 1\right) - 35 \gt - x - 35
    \]
  </p>

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
      \begin{align*}
      & - 7 \left(x - 1\right) - 35 \gt - x - 35\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & - 7x + 7 - 35 \gt - x - 35 & \textrm{Distributed.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & - 7x -28 \gt - x - 35 & \textrm{Simplified.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & - 7x  \gt - x - 7 & \textrm{Added 7 to both sides.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad & - 6x  \gt - 7 & \textrm{Added \(x\) to both sides.}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad &  6x  \lt 7 & \textrm{Negated both sides}\\
      \Rightarrow \quad &  x  \lt \frac{7}{6} & \textrm{Divided both sides by 6}\\
