  What is a logarithm?  We shall soon find out&mdash;by first
  considering questions that naturally arise out of our study of exponential functions.
</p>
<p>
  The point of logarithms can be seen when you consider questions of this sort:
  How long will it take you to reach a particular investment goal?
  For instance, consider
  the following activity.
</p>
<p>
 <div class="activity">
  <h2></h2>

Suppose you have $1000, but you wish you had $2000.
Of course, you can invest the money, and, in time, you will have that much money.
The question is, how long will it take?  Say that a bank is offering to
pay 3% APR in interest, compounded monthly.
How long will it take you to earn that much money?  To figure it out,
you write down everything you know about this situation; you write
down an equation.  Recall the formula:
\[
A(t) = P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]
In this case, we know
\[
A(t) = 1000\left(1+\frac{0.03}{12}\right)^{12t}
\]
This time, I chose 3% just so you could rewrite \(1+\frac{r}{n}\)
in a slightly more convenient way:
\[
1+\frac{r}{n}= 1 + \frac{0.03}{12} =1 + .0025 = 1.0025
\]
We want to find out when (for what \(t\)) \(A(t) = 2000\).  So, really, what we need is to solve the following equation:
\[
2000 = 1000 \cdot 1.0025^{12t}
\]
We want to know what real number \(t\) will make this true.
This is a different sort of equation than we have previously encountered,
but it's still just an equation; we can still simplify it in the usual ways.
For instance, we could divide both sides by 1000.  Here is what we get:
\[
2 = 1.0025^{12t}
\]
Now, at this point, we could observe that we need to know the answer to
this question: "What
exponent can you raise 1.0025 to to hit the target 2."
If we can figure that out, then we can reason that \(t\) will be that
exponent divided by 12.  Do you see why I say that?
So, as a preliminary task for this section, I want you to repeatedly
guess-and-check with your calculator until you find an exponent that will work
(or, if you like, a \(t\) that will work).  What exponent can you raise
1.0025 to to hit the target 2?  Guess and check to find out.
</div>
</p>

<p>
So, guess-and-checking can be kind of fun, but it can also take a while.
Lucky for us, the calculator has an algorithm for answering just the sort of
question that we considered in this previous activity; all we need to know is how to <em>ask it</em>.

<p>
Now, think about it as a general notion: How does one interact with a computer
(which your calculator certainly is)?  The way a human interacts with a
computer&mdash;and, vice versa, a computer interacts with a human&mdash;is
always through the interchange of symbols.  The symbols mean something to you
(if they didn't, the computer would be unintelligible and useless to you, as a
computer in another language would.) To the computer, the symbols don't mean
anything.  Instead, they meant something only to the programmer who programmed
the computer to offer those symbols under the right circumstances, while the
computer can be regarded as an (unsentient) automaton. This is the point: Your
job, as the human in this relationship, is to know the meaning of symbols: they
are both your way of asking a computer to do something and your way of
interpreting the result of the computer's work.  It is the computer's job,
on the other hand, to do slavish mechanical calculations.  The slavish work
we want the computer to do in this case is to "Find the exponent
that you can raise 1.0025 to to hit the target 2."  <em>The symbol</em>,
in this case, will involve the word (which is just a symbol itelf)
"<span class="typewriter">log</span>."  The meaning of this symbol,
in other words, is to provide a
marker for the act of raising questions of the form "what exponent can I raise
a particular given base to to hit a particular given target?"
We will see exactly how to use the symbol <span class="typewriter">log</span>
to symbolize the answer to such a question in a moment.
But first we turn to some simpler questions of this form as a further
illustration of the concept.
<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2> (Warm-up)</h2>
Consider each of the following questions.  Solve each using guess-and-check
(enlisting the help of  a calculator is fine, but isn't really necessary.)

<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/c3db4549f2d54431b91e31e154cc592c" target="_blank">Click for video</a>
<ol>
<li>
Solve the equation, \(2^x = 8\).
</li>
<li>
Solve the equation \(9^x = 81\)
</li>
<li>
The way you might phrase the first question is this: "What exponent can
I raise 2 to to hit the target 8?"  Answer this question, instead:
"What exponent can I raise 2 to to hit the target 32?"  Guess and check if you need to.'
</li>
<li>
Another way you might phrase the first question is by asking, "8 is
worth how many factors of 2?"  So, answer this: "27 is worth how many factors of 3?"
</li>
<li>
How many factors of 6 is 36 worth?
</li>
<li>
Solve the equation \(2^x = \frac{1}{2}\).  To put it another way, we regard \(\frac{1}{2}\)
</li>
<li>
Solve the equation \(2^x = 1\).  What power of 2 do we regard 1 to be&mdash;or, how many factors of 2 is 1 worth?
</li>
<li>
Solve the equation \(2^x = \sqrt{2}\).  What power of 2 do we regard \(\sqrt{2}\)
to be&mdash;or, how many factors of 2 is  \(\sqrt{2}\) worth?
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Now, hopefully those questions weren't so hard.  Here's one which isn't so easy.

<p>
 <div class="activity">
  <h2></h2>


<a href="https://www.loom.com/share/03c9b9a48a034cae8c5a7e5388656a67" target="_blank">Click for video</a>
What exponent can I raise \(2\) to to hit the target \(17\)?  In other words, what is solution to
the equation
\[
2^x = 17
\]
Notice what is \ul{not} a solution if this equation: \(\sqrt{17}\).  Instead, \(\sqrt{17}\)
is a solution to the equation \(x^2 = 17\); don't get the two confused!
Now, this is just the sort of question that we will ask the calculator to solve for us.
Imagine, you might do a guess-and-check process (assisted by the calculator)
to try to "zero-in" on a solution.  Luckily, we learn a way (see below for a
definiton of logarithms!) for how to directly ask the calculator to just give
us an answer (accurate to 10 decimal places) without having to guess and check.
However, I do want you to be able to say "zero in" on the answer yourself just a
little&mdash;by find what two consecutive integers \(x\) must be between.
Identify those now.
</div>
</p>

<div class="example">

    </div>
  </div>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<P>
So, what are the <em>actual</em> solutions to the previous three problems?
Time for the big reveal.  We learn the following symbol&mdash;which is the
manner in which we ask the calculator
how to find the answers; we learn the definition of <em>logarithms</em>.
<p>
<div class="definition">
  <h2></h2>
For appropriate real numbers, we define the symbol
\[
\log_b (A)
\]
to be the solution to the equation
\[
b^x = A
\]
In words, \(\log_b{(A)}\) is "the number of factors of \(b\) that \(A\) is
worth" or "the exponent
that we raise \(b\) to to hit the target \(A\)."   The number \(b\) in the
symbol is called the <b>base of the logarithm</b>&mdash;because it is the base
of the corresponding exponential.  I'm not aware of a special name for the \(A\),
but
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1ZCEB_enUS859US859&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=log-end&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7n-f56JrpAhUPd98KHU1jAGwQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1024&bih=576&safe=active&ssui=on" target="_blank">here is a reasonable name for it.</a>

<p>
For example, while the most I can tell you off the top of my head about the solution to the equation
\[
2^x = 17
\]
is that \(x\) is between 4 and 5, I also know the symbol for the answer is given in
\[
x = \log_2{(17)}
\]
</div>
</p>
You also often see the symbol displayed without parentheses as \(\log_b{A}\).
However, that is inadvisable; the parentheses are used to communicate that
\(\log_b\) is actually the symbol for a <em>function</em>&mdash;namely,
the one that takes the output of the exponential function \(b^x\) as its
input and returns the input that led to that output.  That is, when you see
"\(\log_b(x)\)" this is reall like seeing "\(f(x)\)"&mdash;except that there are 4 letters
that make up the symbol for the function \(\log_b\) but only one letter that
makes up the symbol for the (hypothetical) function \(f\).

<p>
<div class="example">

  <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/5ee4a1609a174f12a1d7820881980a45" target="_blank">Click for video</a>
Figure out the numerical value of each symbol without using a calculator.
<ol>
<li>
\(\log_2 (16)\)
</li>
<li>
\(\log_{10} (1000)\)
</li>
<li>
\(\log_3 (9)\)
</li>
<li>
\(\log_{3} \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)\)
</li>
<li>
\(\log_2 \left(\sqrt{2}\right)\)
</li>
<li>
\(\log_{10} \left(0.0001\right)\)
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Now, as I have mentioned a couple times already, your calculator also uses symbols
involving the word <span class="typewriter">log</span>, which we can employ to get the answer to get precise answers
to the problems in the activity above.  Let me show you how to do that.
<ol>
<li>
First, find the [MATH] button (at left)
</li>
<li>
Then find option <span class="typewriter">A: logBASE(</span> (at right)
</li>
</ol>


<div style="text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/MATH-button.png') }}" style="float:left">
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/MATH-menu-showing-logBASE.png') }}" style="float:left;">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p  style="clear:left">
Actually, in the case of two special bases, you don't have quite so many buttons to push.


<p>
<div class="definition">
  <h2></h2>
In most high school and college texts, when you see \(\log\) without a subscript,
it represents a base-10 logarithm:
\[
\log = \log_{10}
\]
This is similar to how you drop the decoration on the radical when denoting
square-root&mdash;as opposed to cube root or \(4^\textrm{th}\) root, which
requires special identification.
However, many texts and programming languages use the symbol <span class="typewriter">log</span> to
represent the base-\(e\) logarithm.
</div>
</p>
So, when you are wanting the TI to compute the value of a base-10 logarithm, just reach
for the "<span class="typewriter">log</span>" button:
<div class="center" style="text-align:center">
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/log-button.png') }}">
</div>

<p>
<div class="definition">
  <h2></h2>
Remember base \(e\) from the previous section?  It is so important, its associated logarithm
also gets a special symbol: <span class="typewriter">ln</span>.  Put another way:
\[
\ln = \log_e
\]
Also, you will need to know that this \(\ln\) function is called the
<b>natural logarithm</b>.  Why is it called that?  It is because the base \(e\)
ends up "naturally arising" in applications.  I doubt that I have fully convinced
you of that, but it's so.  So, the 'l' in "\(\ln\)" stands for "logarithm"
and the 'n' stands for "natural."  Why is it backwards?  I believe it is because
the symbol was invented by or for speakers of French, which reverses noun and
adjective, as in "<i>log naturel</i>," I suppose.

</p>
It also gets a special button on the calculator:

  <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2043df9502b1434baee0d4604b5cf413" target="_blank">Click for video</a>
  Write the '\(\log\)' symbol for each of the following (using '\(\ln\)'
  for base-\(e\)).  Then use your calculator to find a precise estimate.
  Round to 3 decimal places.

\(e^x = 0.39\)

</p>
Now to the main attraction: We answer questions of the form, "How long until
we reach a certain goal?"
<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
Say that you have \$1000, invested at 4% interest, compounded monthly.
How long until you have \$2000, assuming you make no withdrawals?
Write your answer in terms of a logarithm before also using your calculator
to obtain a numerical value rounded to two decimal places.
Include the units of your answer.
  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
Using the formula
\[
A(t) = P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]
we need to find the \(t\) that satisfies
\[
2000 = 1000 \left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{12t}
\]
For starters, you can divide both sides by 1000:
\[
2 = \left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)^{12t}
\]
Now, we don't know what exponent we can raise \(\left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)\) to to hit
the target  \(2\), but we do know a symbol for it.  That is, it must be that
\[
12t = \log_{\left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)}\left(2\right)
\]
Note: that monster on the right is just the symbol for a number.
Your calculator can help you out with that, but let's throw one more
task on top of the calculator (it won't mind); you can also divide both
sides by 12 to get a <em>symbolic</em> solution for \(t\):
\[
t = \frac{\log_{\left(1+\frac{0.04}{12}\right)}\left(2\right)}{12}
\]
Here is what it looks like when I plug it all into my calculator:
<div class="center" style="text-align:center">
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/log-solution-to-investment-example.png') }}">

As you can see, the <em>numerical</em> answer is

t \approx 17.36 \textrm{ years}
\]

Say that you have \$4000, invested at 2.39% interest, compounded continuously.
How long until you have \$5000, assuming you make no withdrawals?

Include the units of your answer.
  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>
Note the buzzword, "continuously compounded."  This signals the fact that we must
use the formula
\[
A(t) = Pe^{rt}
\]
We solve as follows:
\begin{align*}
& 5000 = 4000 e^{0.0239t} &\\
\Rightarrow \quad & \frac{5}{4} = e^{0.0239t} & \textrm{(Divide both sides by 4000)}\\
\Rightarrow \quad& 0.0239t = \log_e\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) & \textrm{(Recall: }\ln=\log_e \textrm{.)}\\
\Rightarrow \quad & t = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)}{0.0239} \approx 9.34 \textrm{ years} &

& 2 = 61 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{4.8}} &\\
\Rightarrow \quad & \frac{2}{61} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{4.8}} & \textrm{(Divide both sides by 6)}\\
\Rightarrow \quad & \frac{t}{4.8} = \log_{\frac{1}{2}}^{\phantom{1}}\left(\frac{2}{61}\right) & \textrm{(Definition of logarithms)}\\
\Rightarrow \quad & t = 4.8\log_{\frac{1}{2}}^{\phantom{1}}\left(\frac{2}{61}\right) & \textrm{(Multiply by 4.8.)}\\
