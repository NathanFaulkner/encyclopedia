  <span style="color:blue"><b>Question:</b></span> What do you get when you add,

  <span style="color:red"><b>Answer:</b></span> Another rational function!
</p>
<p>
  In this section, we'll look at some ugly examples of rational
  functions added or subtracted with other rational functions and then
  divided by something just as bad.  Why on Earth would we want to do that?
  Well, it so happens that you might just encounter such things in your natural
  mathematical ecosystem of future math classes.  A second reason: because we
  can hopefully make them not nearly so bad as I am making them sound right now.
  Example time!

  Simplify the following.  (Your goal should be to write it plainly as a
  polynomial over another polynomial, as well as to look to factor these
  polynomials and cancel like factors, wherever possible.)
  \[
    \frac{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{2}{x-1}}{\frac{3}{x}+5}
  \]

We can treat the numerator and denominator as separate addition/subtraction problems.  Then we'll have a fraction divided by a fraction, which we can also handle just fine.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{2}{x-1}}{\frac{3}{x}+5} & = \frac{\frac{x-1}{x(x-1)}-\frac{2x}{x(x-1)}}{\frac{3}{x}+ \frac{5x}{x}}\\
& = \frac{\frac{x-1 - 2x}{x(x-1)}}{\frac{3+5x}{x}}\\
& = \frac{\frac{-x-1}{x(x-1)}}{\frac{3+5x}{x}} \\
& = \frac{-x-1}{\cancel{x}(x-1)}\cdot \frac{\cancel{x}}{3+5x} \\
& = \frac{-x-1}{(x-1)(3+5x)}\\
& = \frac{-(x+1)}{(x-1)(3+5x)}
\end{align*}
At the end, there, I factored the numerator just in case I could get a common factor in the numerator and denominator, but I couldn't.

Another way to handle it is to multiply "top and bottom" of this "big" fraction by factors
that will kill off the denominators of the "fractions within the fraction," like so:\begin{align*}
\frac{\frac{1}{x}-\frac{2}{x-1}}{\frac{3}{x}+5} & = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{x}-\frac{2}{x-1}\right)}{\left(\frac{3}{x}+5\right)} \cdot \frac{x(x-1)}{x(x-1)}\\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{\cancel{x}}\cdot \cancel{x}(x-1) - \frac{2}{\cancel{(x-1)}}x\cancel{(x-1)}}{\frac{3}{\cancel{x}}\cdot \cancel{x}(x-1) + 5x(x-1) }\\
& = \frac{(x-1) - 2x}{3(x-1) + 5x^2 - 5x}\\
& = \frac{-x-1}{5x^2 - 5x + 3x - 3}\\
& = \frac{-x-1}{5x^2 - 2x - 3}\\
& = \frac{-x-1}{5x^2 - 5x + 3x - 3}\\
& = \frac{-x-1}{5x(x-1) + 3(x-1)}\\
& =\frac{-(x+1)}{(5x+3)(x-1)}
\end{align*}

This time, I'll just use "Method 1," but, really, you can take your pick.
First, get a common denominator in the numerator and likewise in the denominator.  I combine the fractions in the numerator and do likewise in the denominator.  Then I have a little division problem.
\begin{align*}
\frac{- \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{x}}{5 - \frac{1}{x}} &= \frac{-\frac{3x}{2x}+\frac{6}{2x}}{\frac{5x}{x} - \frac{1}{x}}\\
&= \frac{\frac{-3x+6}{2x}}{\frac{5x-1}{x}}\\
& = \frac{-3x+6}{2\cancel{x}}\cdot \frac{\cancel{x}}{5x-1}\\
& = \frac{-3(x-2)}{2(5x-1)}
\end{align*}

That's pretty much it!  In a way, it isn't that complicated&mdash;though it can definitely be messy, annoying, and tedious.
