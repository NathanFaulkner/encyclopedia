  Next, we learn how to graph a quadratic when it is
  given in a pretty "generic" form: <b>standard form</b>.
  <div class="definition">
    <h2></h2>
    A quadratic written in the form
      \begin{equation*}\tag{Standard Form}
        ax^2+bx+c
      \end{equation*}
    is said to be in <b>standard form</b>.
  </div>
  For example,
    \[
      y = 2x^2 - 8x + 11
    \]
  is in standard form.
</p>

<p>
  So, what are we supposed to do with that?  Recall that it is pretty
  straight-forward to graph a function in the form \(a(x-h)^2+k\).
  Note that this is called "vertex" form because you can just
  read the vertex off from it; it is \((h,k)\).
  Our strategy is actually to figure out how to put the standard
  form equation into vertex form!
  I'll train you on how to do
  that in the following example.
  My claim to you will be that, if you can put vertex form into
  standard form (which is something you would have done in the
  section
  <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='warmupwithquadratics') }}">
    Warm-Up with Quadratics
  </a>)
  then you can do the reverse, as demonstrated next.

    <p>
      We are going to put \(y=2x^2 - 8x+11\) into vertex form,
      i.e., \(y=a(x-h)^2+k\).
      The procedure is to follow these basic steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        We want to find \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) that will make the following equation true:
          \[
            2x^2 - 8x + 11 = a(x-h)^2+k
          \]
        The trick is to realize that, if this equation is true, then
        we should be able to multiply the right side all out and it will
        still equal the left side.  Do that now, using the given letters
        as stand-ins for the unknown numbers we seek (in other words,
        in the usual manner of algebra!)

            \begin{align*}
              a(x-h)^2+k &= a(x-h)(x-h) + k & \textrm{Getting ready to ``FOIL''}\\
              &= a\left(x^2 - hx - hx + h^2\right) + k & \textrm{Did it.}\\
              &= a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k & \textrm{Collected like terms}\\
              &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k & \textrm{Distributed the \(a\).}
            \end{align*}
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
         Using the previous step, identify what \(a\) will have to be.

          <div class='inner'>
            So, we have learned that \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) will have to satisfy
            the following equation:
            \[
              2x^2 - 8x + 11 = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k
            \]
            Now, just look at it: What \(a\) will do the trick?  Of course,
            if we took \(a = 2\), we'd be making progress, no?  That way,
            at least the '\(x^2\)' terms would match up.

        Use your answer from the previous step to find what \(h\) would

          <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
          <div class='inner'>
            We can fill in our value of \(2\) for \(a\) and then see
            what \(h\) will seem to work:
            \begin{align*}
              2x^2 - 8x + 11 &= 2x^2 - 2\cdot 2 \cdot h x + 2h^2 + k \\
              & = 2x^2 - 4h x + 2h^2 + k
            \end{align*}
            I'm already happy with the \(x^2\)-term.  Now, I just keep
            going "down the line", comparing coefficients as I go.
            What value for \(h\) will make the
            \(x\)-term work out?
            Here is a side-by-side comparison of what we are after, with some
            color-coding so you can see what I am looking at:
            \[
              2x^2 \; {\color{cyan}- 8x} + 11 = 2x^2 \; {\color{cyan}- 4h x} + 2h^2 + k
            \]
            So, we need an \(h\) that makes
            \[
              -8x = -4h x
            \]
            or, in other words, we need that
            \[
              -8 = -4h
            \]
            So, of course, \(h\) ought to be \(2\)!
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your answer from the previous step to find what \(k\) would

          <div class='inner'>
            We can fill in our value of \(2\) for \(h\) and then see
            what \(k\) will seem to work:
            \begin{align*}
              2x^2 - 8x + 11 &= 2x^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot x + 2\cdot 2^2 + k \\
              & = 2x^2 - 8 x + 8 + k
            \end{align*}
            We already knocked out the \(x^2\) and \(x\) terms.  Now, we
            just figure out what \(k\) will make the "constant" terms
            match up.
            Here is a side-by-side comparison of what we are after, with some
            color-coding so you can see what I am looking at:
            \[
              2x^2 - 8x \; {\color{cyan}+ 11} = 2x^2 - 8 x \; {\color{cyan} + 8 + k}
            \]
            We need that
            \[
              11 = 8 + k
            \]
            So, of course, \(k = 3\)!

        Write down your final answer&mdash;the vertex form of the given quadratic.
        <div class="answer">
          <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
          <div class='inner'>
            Just fill in the values for \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\):
            \[
              y = a(x - h)^2 + k = 2(x - 2)^2 + 3
            \]
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        In all, this method could be described as "figure out what
        \(a\) \(h\), and \(k\) would have to be to make the answer check
        out right."  That is, if we multiply our vertex form back out, it
        ought to take us back to the standard form.  Just double check that
        now.  (This step is quite redundant, but I am just including
        it in case it helps a light bulb turn on for you!)

              &= 2x^2 - 8x + 11 & \textrm{Simplified}
            \end{align*}
            Look!  We did it!  The vertex form we supplied is indeed equivalent
            to the given standard form.  (By the way, this might be a
            good time to ask yourself what it means for two formulas to be "equivalent"
            in math: it means that they are the same in a special sense: they
            look different, but no matter what values you plug in for the variables,
            they would come out the same.  In other words, they define the same
            function/input-output relationship.)

    Rewrite in vertex form and then graph the function
    \[
      f(x) = -x^{2} + 4 x - 6
    \]

      <div class="answer">

        <div class='inner'>
          First, write an equation that expresses your goal:
          to find \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\)
          such that
          \[
            -x^2 + 4x - 6 = a(x - h)^2 + k
          \]
          Multiply the right side all out, and then, one-by-one, deduce what
          values of \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) will work:
          \begin{align*}
            -x^2 + 4x - 6 &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\
            &= a(x-h)(x-h) + k & \textrm{Getting ready to ``FOIL''}\\
            &= a\left(x^2 - hx - hx + h^2\right) + k & \textrm{Did it.}\\
            &= a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k & \textrm{Collected like terms}\\
            &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k & \textrm{Distributed the \(a\).}
          \end{align*}
          Here it is rewritten in a single line for easier visual comparison:
          \[
            -x^2 + 4x - 6 = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k
          \]
          Now, I figure out what \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) will work by considering
          terms one at a time, left to right.  First I see that if I choose
          \(a\) so that
          \[
            -x^2 = ax^2
          \]
          I'll be doing good.  Of course, that means choosing \(a = -1\).
          So, I fill that in:
          \begin{align*}
          -x^2 + 4x - 6 &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k\\
                        &= -x^2 - 2(-1)h x + (-1)h^2 + k \\
                        &= -x^2 + 2h x - h^2 + k
          \end{align*}
            <p>
              Next I find \(h\) and \(k\) by continuing to
              compare the coefficients, one-by-one.
              I'm already happy with the \(x^2\)-term.  Now, I just keep
              going "down the line", comparing coefficients as I go.
              What value for \(h\) will make the
              \(x\)-term work out?
              Here is a side-by-side comparison of what we are after, with some
              color-coding so you can see what I am looking at:
              \[
                -x^2 \; {\color{cyan}+ \; 4x} - 6 = -x^2 \; {\color{cyan}+ \; 2h x} - h^2 + k
              \]
              So, we need an \(h\) that makes
              \[
                4x = 2h x
              \]
              or, in other words, we need that
              \[
                4 = 2h
              \]
              So, of course, \(h\) ought to be \(2\)!  So, I fill that in
              as well:
              \begin{align*}
              -x^2 + 2h x - h^2 + k &= -x^2 + 2\cdot 2 x - 2^2 + k \\
              & = -x^2 + 4x - 4 + k
              \end{align*}
              It helps to recopy this side-by-side with the given.
              \[
                -x^2 + 4x - 6 = x^2 + 4x - 4 + k
              \]
              Here it is color-coded, so you can see what I am looking at next:
              \[
                -x^2 + 4x \; {\color{cyan}-\; 6} = x^2 + 4x \; {\color{cyan}-\; 4 + k}
              \]
              So, \(k\) will have to satisfy
              \[
                -6 = - 4 + k
              \]
              Solving, I get \(k = -2\).
              In all, I get this vertex form expression by filling
              in the values of \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\):
              \begin{align*}
                f(x) &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\
                    &= -1(x - 2^2 - 2 \\
                    &= -(x - 2)^2 - 2
              \end{align*}
              From this, I can graph the function.  If you need
              to review how to do that, you should head on over to the
              section on
              <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='vertexform') }}">
                graphing from vertex form
              </a>
              But, as a brief review,
              I interpret the vertex
              form as a transformation of \(y = x^2\):  Because of the
              "\(+2\)" next to \(x\), I know that the graph
              involves a translation left 2 units.  Because of the
              negative in front of the squared term, I know the
              graph involves a reflection across the \(x\)-axis&mdash;making
              the \(y\)-values head towards the negatives.  Because of
              the "\(-2\)" added on there, I know the graph will
              involve a translation down 2 units.   So, this is my graph:
              <div style="text-align:center">

        <div class='inner'>
          You may find the process I just demonstrated to be kind of tedious and
          overly-involved.  So, you are the type of person to ask, "Isn't there
          an easier way?"  And, yes, there is perhaps an easier way&mdash;an
          easier way that pretty much amounts to the same thing but is less
          trouble to write down.  Here goes:

          <p>
            Recall that our goal is to find \(a\), \(h\), and  \(k\) so that
            \[
              -x^2 + 4x - 6 = a(x - h)^2 + k
            \]
            You have to be able to at least partially imagine what it would
            be like to multiply the right side all out and then to compare
            coefficients.  The right side would end up looking like this:
            \[
              a(x^2 - 2h x + h^2) + k
            \]
            The way this method proceeds is to leave some blanks where
            the terms involving \(h\) and \(k\) go and then fill them in bit-by-bit.
            But first, you have to factor out the coefficient on \(x^2\)
            from <em>both</em> the \(x^2\) and \(x\) terms.  While you are doing that,
            go ahead and leave yourself some blank space, like so:
            \[
              -x^2 + 4x - 6  = -(x^2 - 4x + \phantom{44}) - 6
            \]
            Next up, you ask yourself what to add into that blank space
            within the parentheses.  The idea is that, for this right side to follow
            the pattern set by the generic format of
            \[
              a(x^2 - 2h x + h^2) + k
            \]
            you'll need that the number that fills in the blank will have to be the
            square of half the coefficient of \(x\) in the middle.  After all,
            what should go in the "blank" is \(h^2\), and \(2h\) actually appears
            in the middle, as that coefficient on \(x\).  So you take half
            that coefficient (to get \(h\)) and then square it to get what goes in
            the blank.  In this case, the middle coefficient is
            \(-4\), so \(h\) must be \(-2\), and therefore \(h^2 = (-2)^2 = 4\).
            You can go ahead and fill in the blank, but BE CAREFUL,
            your expression won't be equivalent to what you started with just yet: some
            tweaking will have to be done to the numbers outside the
            parentheses:
            \[
              -x^2 + 4x - 6  = -(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 6 - \textrm{one further tweak}
            \]
            Now, at this point, I have just inserted a '\(4\)' just because
            I felt like it.  Is that legit math?  No, no exactly: our expression
            will not be equivalent to the given if we change in any old, arbitrary
            way like that.  So, we have to tweak it.  We <em>like</em> the
            '\(4\)' we inserted, but we have to pay for it somehow; we can't get it
            for free.  Really, since the \(4\) is inside parentheses with a minus
            out front, I have really arbitrarily added \(-4\) to the expression
            we started with.  So, to make it right&mdash;to make it equivalent
            to the given&mdash;I just need to take away \(-4\) outside the parentheses.
            Of course, taking away \(-4\) means adding \(4\), if you like.
            So, the following statement is true:
            \begin{align*}
              -x^2 + 4x - 6  &= -(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 6 - (-4) \\
              &= -(x^2 - 4x +4) - 6 + 4 \\
              & = -(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 2
            \end{align*}
            Now, the point of inserting that \(4\) to begin with was to make
            an expression that conforms to the pattern seen when multiplying
            out a square:
            \[
              a(x - h)^2 + k = a(x^2 - 2h x + h^2) + k
            \]
            We now have something on our hands of the form of the right-hand side
            of this equaiton, which means we can rewrite it according to the
            form of the left-hand side.  In other words, we can now
            make the observation that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a square.  It is
            what you get by expanding \((x-2)^2\).  Thus,
            \[
              -(x^2 - 4x + 4) - 2 = -(x-2)^2 - 2
            \]
            The expression on the right is our final, vertex form of the given.
            </p>

            <p>
            By the way, this "fill in the blank" process that I am
            demonstrating here is called <b>completing the square</b>.  It
            refers to the fact that you have left a blank inside the
            squared term and thus have to fill it in or "complete it".
            This is a favorite buzzword of math teachers!  There are different
            ways of narrating how to accomplish this, but they all amount
            to about the same thing.  Perhaps you will like my first method
            better, as it is more step-by-step.  The first method
            involves a little less mental juggling, but, as a trade-off, has farmed
            that mental juggling to the paper, so it involves
            more writing.  So, you'll just have to decide which method gets
            better outcomes for you&mdash;slow and steady (tortoise beats
            hare) or quick like a bunny.  Or perhaps you will like
            a kind of cheater's method, which involves a formula.  That's what
            the next method is about.

        <div class='inner'>
          Finally, let me show you a formula or algorithm for
          accomplishing this task.  (By the way, as noted
          in the explanation of Alternate Method I, this task is called
          <b>completing the square</b> by math teachers.)  I am going to first
          <em>derive</em> the formula, but, in the end, the point is just
          to know the formula whether you know how to derive it or not.
          You can derive or come up with this formula simply by doing my original
          method to the "generic" problem.  That is, take a generic
          quadratic written in standard form:
          \[
            f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
          \]
          where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are some given numbers.  Also,
          \(a \not = 0\), because that would make it linear&mdash;which
          we already know how to graph and don't need to bother with
          any fancy formulas for.
          Then, to put it into vertex form, we need to find \(h\) and \(k\)
          so that:
          \[
            ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - h)^2 + k\\
          \]
          Spoiler alert: \(a\) is \(a\)!  Same on both sides.  What does that
          mean for our solving process?  It means that whatever number
          is the coefficient of \(x^2\) in the standard form expression
          will also be the coefficient of the squared term in the vertex
          form expression.  Now, for the rest of it, we expand
          out the right side and compare coefficients:
          \begin{align*}
            ax^2 + bx + c &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\
            &= a(x-h)(x-h) + k & \textrm{Getting ready to ``FOIL''}\\
            &= a\left(x^2 - hx - hx + h^2\right) + k & \textrm{Did it.}\\
            &= a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k & \textrm{Collected like terms}\\
            &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k & \textrm{Distributed the \(a\).}
          \end{align*}
          Here is what we deduced, written in a single line:
          \[
            ax^2 + bx + c = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k
          \]
          So, what about \(h\)?  Compare the coefficients
          on \(x\): it will work out if \(h\) satisfies
          \[
            b = -2ah
          \]
          So,
          \[
            h = -\frac{b}{2a}
          \]
          I solved for \(h\)!  So, this formula will work every time.
          In words, it says to find the coefficient (\(b\))
          of \(x\) in the standard form presentation.  Make it negative,
          and then divide by twice the coefficient of \(x^2\).  That will
          be your \(h\), which has to go after the <em>negative</em>
          in the vertex format.  So, for example, if you are given
          \[
            f(x) = -x^2 - 4 x - 6
          \]
          then your \(a = -1\) and your \(b = -4\).  Thus,
          \[
            h = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-4}{2 (-1)} = \frac{4}{-2} = -2
          \]
          Thus, the vertex form is partially determined:
          \[
            a(x - h)^2 + k = -(x - (-2))^2 + k = -(x + 2)^2 + k
          \]

          <p>
            Now, what about \(k\)?  Well, we could continue in the same
            fashion.  But, the formula you get isn't all that nice.
            I don't think it is fun or very useful to memorize formulas,
            but you might tend to disagree with me on that.  So,
            let's check it out just to see.
            Going back to the task of comparing coefficients, I have
            copied our template from above:
            \[
              ax^2 + bx + c = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k
            \]
            So, looking at the "constant" terms (the parts without \(x\)),
            we see that \(k\) needs to satisfy
            \[
            c = ah^2 + k
            \]
            Solving for \(k\) is actually quite easy:
            \[
              k = c - ah^2
            \]
            So, there you have it!  First, deduce what \(h\) is, and then
            perform this formula to get \(k\).  Of course, you also
            have to remember the formula.  Are you sure that you will?
            How long will you remember the formula? Well, let's see it demonstrated.
            Again, working from the given of
            \[
              f(x) = -x^2 - 4 x - 6
            \]
            we have \(a = -1\) and \(c = -6\).  We also already
            figured out that
            that \(h = -2\).  Therefore,
            \[
              k = c - ah^2 = -6 - (-1)(-2)^2 = -6 - (-1)\cdot 4 = -6- (-4) = -6 + 4 = -2
            \]
            Mind your order of operations!  So, there you have it.
            Filling in the values in our final answer, we have the vertex
            form is
            \[
              a(x - h)^2 + k = -1(x - (-2))^2 - 2 = -(x+2)^2 - 2
            \]
            Now, I have never met anyone (that I am aware of) that memorized
            that formula for \(k\).  It just doesn't seem that fun to me.
            Lucky for you, there is another way to figure out what
            \(k\) is.  You see, \(k\) is just the \(y\)-value that gets
            paired with \(x\) value of \(x = h\).  That is, since \(h = -2\),
            the \(k\) will just be what you get when you plug in \(-2\)
            for \(x\), like so:
            \begin{align*}
              k = f(h) = f(-2) &= -(-2)^2 - 4 (-2) - 6 \\
              &= - 4 + 8 - 6 \\
              &= -2
            \end{align*}
            So, in all, you certainly might consider memorizing the
            facts that if
            \[
              f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
            \]
            (fine print: \(a \not = 0\)) then the format
            \[
              f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k
            \]
            can be obtained by computing
            \[
              h = -\frac{b}{2a}
            \]
            and
            \[
              k = f(h)
            \]

  I am going to demonstrate just one more example, demoing each of the 3 methods
  again, but with a lot less talk:
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>
  <p>
  <!-- <a href="" target="_blank">Click for video.</a> -->
  </p>

  <p>
    Rewrite in vertex form and then graph the function
    \[
      f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2}
    \]
  </p>
      <div class="answer">
        <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
        <div class='inner'>
          First, write an equation that expresses your goal:
          to find \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\)
          such that
          \[
            -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} = a(x - h)^2 + k
          \]
          Multiply the right side all out, and then, one-by-one, deduce what
          values of \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) will work:
          \begin{align*}
            -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\
            &= a(x-h)(x-h) + k & \textrm{Getting ready to ``FOIL''}\\
            &= a\left(x^2 - hx - hx + h^2\right) + k & \textrm{Did it.}\\
            &= a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k & \textrm{Collected like terms}\\
            &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k & \textrm{Distributed the \(a\).}
          \end{align*}
          Here it is rewritten in a single line for easier visual comparison:
          \[
            -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} = ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k
          \]
          Now, I figure out what \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\) will work by considering
          terms one at a time, left to right.  Equating the coefficients
          of the \(x^2\) terms, I see that
          \[
            a = -\frac{1}{2}
          \]
          So, I fill that in:
          \begin{align*}
          -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} &= ax^2 - 2ah x + ah^2 + k\\
                        &= -\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2(-\frac{1}{2})h x + (-\frac{1}{2})h^2 + k \\
                        &= -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + h x -\frac{1}{2} h^2 + k
          \end{align*}
            <p>
              Next I find \(h\) and \(k\) by continuing to
              compare the coefficients, one-by-one.
              I'm already happy with the \(x^2\)-term.  Now, I just keep
              going "down the line": What value for \(h\) will make the
              \(x\)-term work out?
              Here is a side-by-side comparison of what we are after, with some
              color-coding so you can see what I am looking at:
              \[
                -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} \; {\color{cyan} +\; 3 x} - \frac{7}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 \; {\color{cyan}+ \; h x} -\frac{1}{2} h^2 + k
              \]
              Comparing the coefficients of \(x\), I see
              that
              \[
                 h = 3
              \]
              So, I fill that in
              as well, to learn that:
              \begin{align*}
                -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} &= -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + h x -\frac{1}{2} h^2 + k
                & = &= -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3 x -\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3^2 + k \\
                &= -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3 x -\frac{9}{2}  + k
              \end{align*}
              It helps to recopy this side-by-side with the given:
              \[
                -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x - \frac{7}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3 x -\frac{9}{2}  + k
              \]
              Here it is color-coded, so you can see what I am paying attention to
              next:
              \[
                -\frac{1}{2}x^{2} + 3 x \; {\color{cyan}- \; \frac{7}{2}} = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3 x \; {\color{cyan}-\;\frac{9}{2}  + k}
              \]
              So, now what does \(k\) have to be?  Specifically,
              what will  \(k\) have to be to make the "constant" terms
              (just numbers, no \(x\)'s) match up: \(k\) will have to satisfy
              \[
                - \frac{7}{2} = -\frac{9}{2}  + k
              \]
              Solving, I get
              \[
                k = - \frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
              \]
              In all, I get this vertex form expression by filling
              in the values of \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\):
              \begin{align*}
                f(x) &= a(x - h)^2 + k\\
                    &= -\frac{1}{2}(x - 3)^2 + 1 \\
              \end{align*}
              From this, I can graph the function.  If you need
              to review how to do that, you should head on over to the
              section on
              <a href="{{ url_for('section', section_name='vertexform') }}">
                graphing from vertex form
              </a>
              But, as a brief review,
              I interpret the vertex
              form as a transformation of \(y = x^2\):  Because of the
              "\(-3\)" next to \(x\), I know that the graph
              involves a translation right 3 units.  Because of the
              negative in front of the squared term, I know the
              graph involves a reflection across the \(x\)-axis&mdash;making
              the \(y\)-values head towards the negatives.  Because
              the coefficient on the square term also has a magnitude
              of \(\frac{1}{2}\), I know those \(y\)'s will decrease
              at half the rate that they do for \(y = -x^2\).  Because of
              the "\(+ 1\)" added on the end there, I know the graph will
              involve a translation up 1 units.   So, this is my graph:
              <div style="text-align:center">

          To "complete the square", I first need to factor out the coefficient
          on \(x^2\) from both the \(x^2\) term and the \(x\) term.  That's
          a little trickier in this case, so let me talk you through it.
          Factoring out \(-\frac{1}{2}\) would look something like this:
          \[
            -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - ? x + \phantom{44}\right) - \frac{7}{2}
          \]
          When "factoring out", we have to leave something behind.  "Factoring"
          is just a word for "reversing the distributive property"; you might
          call it "undistributing" instead.  So, to figure out what \(?\)
          has to be, just imagine what you could multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\)
          to go back to what you started with&mdash;in other words, to
          get the \(3\) back.  That is, "one half of what number is 3?"
          The answer, I hope you will agree, is \(6\).  That means
           my first step of completing the square looks like this:
           \[
            -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6 x + \phantom{44}\right) - \frac{7}{2} - \textrm{one more tweak}
           \]
           Next, I fill in the blank in such a way that "makes the thing inside
           the parentheses a square."  What does that mean?  It means we want
           to rewrite the part in parentheses in the form \((x - h)^2\).
           To realize how to do that, you have to imagine expanding
           the generic expression \((x-h)^2\) to realize ho to get from one
           form to another:
           \[
            (x-h)^2 = x^2 - 2hx + h^2
           \]
           The observation to make is that you have to fill in the blank with
           the square of one half of the middle coefficient.  The middle
           coefficient (I mean, the coefficient on \(x\)) is \(-6\).
           One half of that is \(-3\), and squaring yields \(9\).  So, that's it!
           That's the next (half-)step of completing the square.  (We just
           "completed the square" when we filled in the blank to make
           the expression inside the parentheses a square.)
           \[
            f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) - \frac{7}{2} - \textrm{one more tweak}
           \]
           Adding \(9\) within the paretheses&mdash;which have a \(-\frac{1}{2}\)
           outside of them as a coefficient&mdash;means that we have arbitrarily
           added
           \[
            -\frac{1}{2}\cdot 9 = - \frac{9}{2}
           \]
           to our expression.  Thus, it is not yet equivalent to the given.
           TO fix it, on the outside of the parentheses, we just take
           \(-\frac{9}{2}\) away again.  (But since we will be taking away
           a negative, you could just register this as <em>adding</em>
           it back in after having taken it away.)
           \begin{align*}
            f(x) &= -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) - \frac{7}{2} - \left(- \frac{9}{2}\right)\\
                &= -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) - \frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2}\\
                &= -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) + \frac{2}{2}\\
                &= -\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2 - 6x + 9\right) + 1
           \end{align*}
           As a final step, we recall why we inserted the \(9\) in the first place:
           to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square:
           \[
            f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(x - 3\right)^2 + 1
           \]
           That's in vertex form!  So, we are ready to graph it.  (See the answer
           above for the graph.)

          We view our given as example of the generic format
          \[
            ax^2 + bx + c
          \]
          Thus, \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = -\frac{7}{2}\).
          THe vertex form
          \[
            a(x-h)^2 + k
          \]
          can be obtained by using \(a = -\frac{1}{2}\) ("same \(a\) in both places")
          and
          \[
            h = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{3}{2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2}} = -\frac{3}{-1} = 3
          \]
          and
          \begin{align*}
            k = f(h) = f(3) &= -\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3^2 + 3\cdot 3 - \frac{7}{2}\\
                            &= -\frac{9}{2} + 9 - \frac{7}{2}\\
                            &= -\frac{16}{2} + 9\\
                            &= -8 + 9\\
                            &= 1
          \end{align*}
          So, in all, our vertex form is
          \[
            a(x - h)^2 + k = -\frac{1}{2}\left(x - 3\right)^2 + 1
          \]
          We are now ready to graph it. (See the answer
          above for the graph.)
