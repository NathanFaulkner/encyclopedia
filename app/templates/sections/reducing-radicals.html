  In this section, we actually only work with fractions in the exponent as
  represented by radicals.  Our goal in this section will be to practice the
  skill of "reducing" or simplifying radicals by looking for "perfect
  \(n^\textrm{th}\) powers"&mdash;for example, perfect squares.
  A quick illustration will get the point across.
</p>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2> (Warm-up)</h2>

Simplify each of the following radicals by using the fact that
\(\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}\).
That is, look for perfect squares to extract and reduce.
<ol>
<li>
\(\sqrt{54}\)
\(\sqrt{8}\)
\(\sqrt{50}\)
</li>
<li>
\item\(\sqrt{108}\)
\item\(\sqrt{60}\)
\item\(\sqrt{48}\)
</li>
</ol>

</div>
</p>

In this section, we are building on that skill.
We will be using the fact that, for real numbers \(a>0\), \(b>0\),
\[
\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a}\sqrt[n]{b}
\]

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical.  (Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt[3]{54} \;{\color{red} =  \sqrt[3]{27\cdot 2} = \sqrt[3]{27}\sqrt[3]{2} = 3\sqrt[3]{2}}
\]
</div>
</p>
This same sort of trick can also be applied when the factors \(ab\)
under the radical are left non-specific&mdash;that is, are written as variables.

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical by using the fact that, for real numbers \(a>0\), \(b>0\),
\(\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a}\sqrt[n]{b}\).  (Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt[3]{2x^3} \; {\color{red} = \sqrt[3]{x^3}\sqrt[3]{2} = x \sqrt[3]{2}}
\]
</div>
</p>
That's mostly it!&mdash;except that we do have to contemplate the "fine print":
What happens when the variables
are actually intended to represent negative numbers?  To answer this,
all you have to do is look at some examples where the numbers involved actually <em>are</em> negative.

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical by using the fact that \(\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a}\sqrt[n]{b}\).
(Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt[3]{-1} \; {\color{red} = \sqrt[3]{(-1)(-1)(-1)} = -1}
\]
</div>
</p>
No big deal there!  Notice, then, that for \(a=-1\), \(\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a\).
Here's another one:

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical by using the fact that \(\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a}\sqrt[n]{b}\).
(Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt[3]{-8} \; {\color{red} = \sqrt[3]{(-2)^3} = -2}
\]
</div>
</p>
So, again, we are seeing an example of where \(a\lt 0\) and still \(\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a\).  But, if you think about it,
you will see that this will not always be the case.

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical by using the fact that \(\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a}\sqrt[n]{b}\).  (Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt{-4} \; {\color{red} = \sqrt{(2i)^2} = 2i??}
\]
</div>
</p>
Actually, we won't bother with examples like this, where we are seeking to
take an even root of a negative number&mdash;that is, where we are
trying to break apart a negative number into an even number of equal factors.
But, the following sort of complication, we will still contend with, in a way:

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical.  (Answer in {\color{red}red}.)
\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2} \; {\color{red} = \sqrt{1} = 1}
\]
</div>
</p>
What's hard about that?  Well, nothing.  Except this: the moral here is that, for \(a\lt0\), it may not
be the case that \(\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a\).  Indeed, for the example of \(a=-1\) and \(n=2\), we find that
\[
\sqrt[n]{a^n} = \sqrt{(-1)^2} \neq -1 = a
\]
Instead, because of the squaring of \(-1\), it comes out positive!
That's not such a big deal.  Indeed, we already have some notational
equipment for denoting the instructions "must come out positive."
What math operation&mdash;think <em>waaay</em> back to the start of
first semester&mdash;do we have that means "must come
out positive?"  I hope you answered (with a moment's thought), "absolute value."  Thus,
\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2} = 1 = |-1|
\]
Consider the following chain of logic.  Note first that \(x^2\)
and \(|x|^2\) come out the same no matter what.  Note, too, that,
for any real number \(a>0\), \(\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a\).  Note, of course that \(|x|>0\).
Then, for any real number \(x\),
\[
\sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{|x|^2} = |x|
\]
That's how I suggest you operate, but you might also find it useful to note the following pair of facts.
<p>
<div class="fact">
  <h2></h2>
For any positive, {\color{red} odd} integer, \(n\), and any real number \(a\),
\[
\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a
\]
but for any positive, {\color{blue} even} integer, \(n\), and any real number \(a\),
\[
\sqrt[n]{a^n} = |a|
\]
</div>

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical.
\[
\sqrt{4x^2y}

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>

Rewrite the the even powers using absolute value&mdash;to acknowledge
that they will come out positive.  Then just operate "like normal."
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{4x^2y} &= \sqrt{4|x|^2y}\\
&= \sqrt{4} \sqrt{|x|^2}\sqrt{y} \\
&= 2|x| \sqrt{y}
\end{align*}

    </div>
  </div>

</div>
</p>
That takes care of that technical detail, but there is still some technique
left to learn.  Take a look at what I am up to in the next examples.

<p>
<div class="example">
  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical.
\[
\sqrt{16x^6y^{12}}
\]

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>

I am looking for perfect squares to "cancel" with the square root symbol.
Of course, \(16=4^2\) is a perfect square.  What about \(x^6\)?
It, too, is a square!  \(x^6 = x^3 \cdot x^3 = \left(x^3\right)^2\).  Similarly,
\(y^{12} = \left(y^6\right)^2\).  So this is how I operate:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{16x^6y^{12}} &= \sqrt{16|x|^6|y|^{12}}  \\
&= \sqrt{16 \left(|x|^3\right)^2\left(|y|^6\right)^2}\\
& {\color{cyan} =  \sqrt{16}\sqrt{\left(|x|^3\right)^2}\sqrt{\left(|y|^6\right)^2}} \\
&= 4|x|^3|y|^6\\
&= 4|x|^3y^6
\end{align*}
I highlighted one step in {\color{cyan} cyan} to highlight a step
that I don't mind if you skip.  Also, in the very last step, I have removed
the absolute value sign over \(y\) because it is redundant: Since \(y\) is being
raised to the \(6^\textrm{th}\) power anyway, it will come out positive
with or without the absolute value sign.  But, actually, I won't count
off if you neglect that last step either.  Really, you don't have to show
work at all, but it will be better for your process (and for potential
partial credit) if you do.

Simplify the radical.
\[
\sqrt[3]{24x^3y^6z^{17}}
\]

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>

I am on a hunt for perfect "cubes"&mdash;powers of 3.
Here is one: \(24 = 8 \cdot 3 = 2^3 \cdot 8\).  I see \(x^3\), as well.
Here is one more: \(y^6 = y^2 y^2 y^2 =\left(y^2\right)^3\).
How about \(z^{17}\)?  Can
it be conveniently broken apart into three equal factors?
The answer is no: because 17 is not
divisible by 3.  But you can still divide 17 by 3&mdash;with remainder.
That is what I will do, rewriting
\[
z^{17} = \left(z^5\right)^3 z^2
\]
In all, I have the following (which, again, you can skip steps if you like, but just use care!)
\begin{align*}
\sqrt[3]{24x^3y^6z^{17}} & = \sqrt[3]{(2)^3  3 (x)^3 \left(y^2\right)^3 \left(z^5\right)^3 z^2}\\
&\color{cyan} = \sqrt[3]{(2)^3} \sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{(x)^3} \sqrt[3]{\left(y^2\right)^3} \sqrt[3]{\left(z^5\right)^3} \sqrt[3]{z^2} \\
&\color{cyan} = \sqrt[3]{(2)^3}  \sqrt[3]{(x)^3} \sqrt[3]{\left(y^2\right)^3} \sqrt[3]{\left(z^5\right)^3} \sqrt[3]{3}\sqrt[3]{z^2} \\
&= 2x^3 y^2 z^5 \sqrt[3]{3z^2}
\end{align*}
You might notice that I didn't fiddle with absolute values in this case.
The reason is that, while it is
accurate to substitute \(|y|^2\) for \(y^2\) it also redundant in the end, since, indeed, \(y^2\) ends
up in the final answer.  Also, the only danger that the absolute value
symbols protect us against is when an even power gets "canceled away" by an even root.
Since this is an odd root, there is no worry.  See the "Fact" above for further comment on this.

  <h2></h2>

Simplify the radical.
\[
\sqrt[4]{32a^5b^{16}}
\]

  <div class="answer">
    <a class="collapsible"><h3>Answer: </h3></a>
    <div class='inner'>

This time I am looking for perfect \(4^\textrm{th}\) powers:
\begin{align*}
\sqrt[4]{32a^5b^{16}} &= \sqrt[4]{2^4 2 a^4 a \left(|b|^4\right)^4} \\
&\color{cyan} = \sqrt[4]{2^4} \sqrt[4]{2} \sqrt[4]{a^4} \sqrt[4]{a} \sqrt[4]{\left(|b|^4\right)^4} \\
&=   2a|b|^4 \sqrt[4]{2a}\\
&=   2a b^4 \sqrt[4]{2a}
\end{align*}
Again, note that you can strip off the absolute value signs at the end on any variables that
are being raised to an even power; they are redundant in that case.
